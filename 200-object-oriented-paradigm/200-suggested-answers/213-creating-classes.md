A method is a function defined inside a class. It always has at least one parameter, usually named `self`, which refers to the specific object calling the method.

</details>

4. What is the purpose of the init method in a class?

<details>

<summary>Show solution</summary>

The `__init__` method is a special method that runs automatically whenever a new object is created from a class. It is typically used to initialise the objectâ€™s attributes.

</details>

5. Is the `init` method required in every Python class? Why might you include it anyway?

<details>

<summary>Show solution</summary>

The `__init__` method is not strictly required, but it is good practice to include it because it provides a clear and consistent place to initialise the attributes of an object when it is created.
