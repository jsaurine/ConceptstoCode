# 223 Setting up your project environment

Before building your OOP app, it’s essential to establish a clear and well-structured development environment. This module guides you through the early stages of project setup, including folder layout, development tools, source control, and code scaffolding.

These foundational steps will help ensure that your project remains manageable and professional as it grows. You’ll begin by creating a sensible directory structure for your app, then set up your Python environment and Git repository. Finally, you’ll write placeholder class files with method stubs that define your app’s early design.

In this module, you will lay the foundations for your Task Tracker app and follow the conventions used by professional developers, including version control and modular source code design.

Each section in this module contributes to a clean, reproducible, and collaborative development process. This setup also makes it easier to extend your project over multiple sprints as part of an Agile workflow.
