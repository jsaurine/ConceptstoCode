# 221 Project brief and planning

### **Outline**

This stage of the software development process defines the overall purpose of the app, identifies key features, and organises the work into small development units. The backlog of tasks is created from user stories, and the initial sprint is planned. Agile principles are used to guide the development process through short, focused iterations.

### **Targets**

In this topic, students learn to:

* Observe how a software problem is defined and structured as an OOP project
* Analyse user needs and translate them into user stories
* Break a solution into sprint-sized development goals
* Follow an agile planning process to initiate project development

| **Sprint**     | A short, focused development cycle in which a small set of features is designed, built, and tested.   |
| **User story** | A brief description of a feature from the userâ€™s perspective.                                         |
| **Backlog**    | A prioritised list of features or user stories to be implemented.                                     |
| **Scope**      | The set of features and goals that define what the project will include.                              |
| **Agile**      | A flexible and iterative approach to software development focused on small, incremental improvements. |

### **Overview**

The Task Tracker app is designed to help users manage their task list using a command-line interface. Users can create tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and view a list of tasks with relevant information such as due dates and descriptions. Each task is represented as an object, and tasks are managed collectively through a separate controlling class.

To begin development, the goals and boundaries of the app are defined. Key user stories are identified and organised into a backlog. The first sprint is prepared by selecting foundational features that will form the core functionality of the app.
