  agile practices.

# 221 Project brief and planning

This module marks the start of Sprint 1. We begin by defining the purpose and boundaries of the Task Tracker app. The module introduces the concept of a backlog, built from user stories, which guides the design and development process. The focus is not yet on implementation, but on clarifying user needs and translating them into system requirements.

Agile development principles are introduced, including the use of a sprint structure to break down work into small, testable goals. These planning foundations support the transition into software design (Section 222) and early implementation (Sections 223–224).

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Observe how a software problem is defined and structured as an OOP project
* Analyse user needs and translate them into user stories
* Break a solution into sprint-sized development goals
* Follow an agile planning process to initiate project development

| Sprint     | A short, focused development cycle in which a small set of features is designed, built, and tested   |
| User story | A brief description of a feature from the user’s perspective                                         |
| Backlog    | A prioritised list of features or user stories to be implemented                                     |
| Scope      | The set of features and goals that define what the project will include                              |
| Agile      | A flexible and iterative approach to software development focused on small, incremental improvements |

### Overview

The Task Tracker app is designed to help users manage their task list using a command-line interface. Users can create tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and view a list of tasks with relevant information such as due dates and descriptions. Each task is represented as an object, and tasks are managed collectively through a separate controlling class.

This module begins the planning phase. Students will:

* Define the project scope
* Write user stories that reflect user needs
* Build a backlog that identifies key features
* Prepare a sprint plan that selects which features to implement first

These planning activities will be completed across three sections:

* [**221.1 Project brief**: Defines the app’s purpose and constraints](221.1-project-brief.md)
* [**221.2 User stories and backlog**: Translates user needs into structured stories and priorities](221.2-user-stories-and-backlog.md)
* [**221.3 Sprint overview**: Outlines the sprint goals and sets up the structure for design and implementation](221.3-sprint-overview.md)

The planning process established in this section sets the foundation for the design work in Section 222 and coding in Section 223 and 224.
