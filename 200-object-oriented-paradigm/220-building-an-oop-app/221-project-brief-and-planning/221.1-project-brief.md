  This section models the development of a simple Task Tracker app, designed
  using object-oriented principles and built through an agile, sprint-based
  process.

# 221.1 Project brief

### **Purpose**

The purpose of the Task Tracker is to help users organise and manage personal tasks using a command-line interface. The app allows users to create new tasks, view existing tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The focus is on producing a working application with a clean object-oriented design that can be extended and refined over time.

### **Intended audience**

This app is intended for a single user who wants to manage tasks on their personal computer. It is designed to run in a terminal or command-line interface, with no graphical interface required. The user is assumed to be comfortable with basic text-based prompts and inputs.

### **Core features**

The minimum viable product (MVP) will support the following:

* Create a new task with a title, description, and due date
* List all tasks with status (completed or incomplete)
* Mark a task as completed or uncompleted
* View task details
* Store multiple tasks in memory

### **Planned extensions (future sprints)**

* Filter tasks by completion status or due date
* Sort tasks alphabetically or by due date
* Save tasks to a file and load them on startup
* Add categories, tags, or priority levels

### **Constraints**

* Text-based interface only
* Data stored in memory for MVP (no persistence yet)
* Python standard library only (no external dependencies)

### **Design approach**

The app will follow an object-oriented design. Each task will be represented as an object, and a separate class will manage the list of tasks and user commands. Agile development principles will be used to break the project into short, focused sprints, with testing and documentation integrated throughout.
