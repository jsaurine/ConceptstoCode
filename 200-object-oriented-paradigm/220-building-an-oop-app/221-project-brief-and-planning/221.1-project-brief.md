  This section models the development of a simple Task Tracker app, designed
  using object-oriented principles and built through an agile, sprint-based
  process.

# 221.1 Project brief

### Purpose

The Task Tracker helps users organise and manage personal tasks via a command-line interface. It supports creating, viewing, and completing tasks using a simple, text-based workflow. The application prioritises clean object-oriented design that can be refined and extended over time.

### Intended audience

The app is designed for individual users who prefer or are comfortable with command-line interfaces. It assumes users can respond to text-based prompts and type simple commands. No GUI or advanced configuration is required.

### Core features (MVP)

The minimum viable product (MVP) will support the following functionality:

* Create a new task with a title, description, and due date
* Display a list of all tasks, showing completion status
* Mark a task as completed or uncompleted
* View detailed information about a selected task
* Store multiple tasks in memory for the session

### Planned extensions (future sprints)

These features are not required for Sprint 1 but may be added in later sprints:

* Filter tasks by status or due date
* Sort tasks alphabetically or by due date
* Save tasks to a file and load them on startup
* Add categories, tags, or priority levels

### Constraints

**Functional constraints:**

* No user authentication or multi-user support
* Command-line interface only
* No mouse or GUI interaction

**Technical constraints:**

* All data stored in memory for MVP (no persistence)
* Written in Python using the standard library only
* Designed using object-oriented principles

### Design approach

The application will use object-oriented design, with the following structure:

* Each task will be represented as an instance of a `Task` class
* A separate class, `TaskManager`, will manage the list of tasks and provide methods for user operations (e.g. add, remove, display)
* The main script will act as the controller, handling user input and calling relevant methods
* Agile development will guide the process, with short sprints, testing, and documentation integrated from the beginning
