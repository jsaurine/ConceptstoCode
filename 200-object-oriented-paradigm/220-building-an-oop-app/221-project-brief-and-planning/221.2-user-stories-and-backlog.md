# 221.2 User stories and backlog

### User stories

User stories describe the desired functionality from the user’s perspective. Each story follows a consistent format, helping to clarify what the system must do and why it matters. These stories provide the foundation for class and method design in the next module.

<table><thead><tr><th width="151.72265625">User story ID</th><th>Story</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>US1</td><td>As a user, I want to create a task by entering a title, description, and due date.</td></tr><tr><td>US2</td><td>As a user, I want to view a list of all my tasks with their completion status.</td></tr><tr><td>US3</td><td>As a user, I want to mark a task as completed or uncompleted.</td></tr><tr><td>US4</td><td>As a user, I want to view the full details of a specific task.</td></tr><tr><td>US5</td><td>As a user, I want to filter tasks by whether they are complete or incomplete.</td></tr><tr><td>US6</td><td>As a user, I want to sort tasks by due date or alphabetically.</td></tr><tr><td>US7</td><td>As a user, I want to save my tasks so they are available the next time I use the app.</td></tr><tr><td>US8</td><td>As a user, I want to add optional categories or priority levels to help organise my tasks.</td></tr></tbody></table>

These stories will be tagged and tracked through sprints to guide development priorities.

### Feature backlog

The backlog groups stories into sprints based on their importance and the sequence of implementation. The first sprint focuses on the minimum viable product (MVP), while later sprints introduce enhancements.

#### Core features (Sprint 1 – MVP)

| Feature                     | Description                                               | Linked User Stories |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Task creation               | Create a new task with a title, description, and due date | US1                 |
| Task storage                | Store multiple tasks in memory                            | US1–US4             |
| Task listing                | Display tasks with title and completion status            | US2                 |
| Mark as complete/incomplete | Change task status                                        | US3                 |
| Task detail view            | View full information for a selected task                 | US4                 |

#### Additional features (Sprint 2+)

| File persistence       | Save/load tasks to/from a file           | US7                 |
| Categories or priority | Add organisational tags or labels        | US8                 |
| Input validation       | Improve user feedback and error handling | Internal            |

### Sprint planning summary

Sprint 1 targets core functionality: creating, storing, and interacting with task objects in memory. It will result in a functional and testable program that utilises OOP principles. Sprint 2 will focus on extending functionality, improving usability, and introducing persistence. Each sprint includes time for testing, refactoring, and updating documentation.
