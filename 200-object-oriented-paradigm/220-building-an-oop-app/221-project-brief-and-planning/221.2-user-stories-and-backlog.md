  describing features from the user’s perspective and organising them into a
  prioritised development backlog.

# 221.2 User stories and backlog

### User stories

User stories describe the functionality of the app in simple, goal-oriented language from the user’s point of view. Each story helps define what the system must be able to do and why it matters. These stories will guide the design of classes and methods in future modules.

* As a user, I want to create a task by entering a title, description, and due date.
* As a user, I want to view a list of all my tasks with their completion status.
* As a user, I want to mark a task as completed or uncompleted.
* As a user, I want to view the full details of a specific task.
* As a user, I want to filter tasks by whether they are complete or incomplete.
* As a user, I want to sort tasks by due date or alphabetically.
* As a user, I want to save my tasks so they are available the next time I use the app.
* As a user, I want to add optional categories or priority levels to help organise my tasks.

### Feature backlog

The feature backlog is a prioritised list of functionality that will be implemented over multiple sprints. The features are grouped into core features for the minimum viable product and additional features for later development.

#### Core features (Sprint 1)

* Create a new task
* Store tasks in a list
* Display all tasks with title and completion status
* Mark a task as complete or incomplete
* View full details of a single task

#### Additional features (Sprint 2)

* Filter tasks by completion status
* Sort tasks by due date or alphabetically
* Save and load task data to/from a file
* Add categories or priority to tasks
* Improve input validation and user feedback

### Sprint planning

Sprint 1 will focus on the core functionality required to create, store, and interact with individual task objects. Sprint 2 will focus on enhancements, including filtering, persistence, and usability improvements. Each sprint includes time for testing and minor refactoring based on results.
