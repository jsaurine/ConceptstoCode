# 221.3 Sprint overview

### Sprint-based development

The Task Tracker app is developed using a sprint-based workflow. Each sprint focuses on a small, achievable set of goals selected from the project backlog. By limiting the scope of each sprint, development becomes more manageable and iterative. Each sprint concludes with a functional version of the program, even if it is partially complete, alongside documented progress.

This agile structure supports early testing, responsive planning, and ongoing refinement.

### What is a sprint?

A sprint is a short, focused period of development, typically lasting one to two weeks in industry settings. In this project, each sprint includes:

* Selecting a small number of user stories from the backlog
* Designing, implementing, and testing new features
* Reviewing and refining code for clarity and efficiency
* Updating documentation and reflecting on progress

At the end of each sprint, students complete a sprint log and prepare for the next development cycle.

### Sprint structure for this project

The development of the Task Tracker app is structured into three phases:

#### Sprint 1: Core functionality

Focus: Build the app's foundation using clean, object-oriented design.

* Implement `Task` and `TaskManager` classes
* Create, store, and display tasks
* Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted
* Test individual features and record results
* Maintain a sprint log with version control and reflections

#### Sprint 2: Feature extensions

Focus: Improve usability and introduce data persistence.

* Add filtering and sorting options
* Save and load tasks from a file
* Introduce optional categories or priority levels
* Strengthen input validation and user guidance
* Update SDS and sprint log with new functionality

#### Final sprint: Quality and refinement

Focus: Consolidate and prepare for the final evaluation.

* Refactor code to improve readability and modularity
* Add structured testing (manual or automated)
* Complete final documentation, including a retrospective
* Prepare the app for demonstration or submission

### Benefits of sprint-based development

Using sprints breaks the project into achievable steps and fosters a real-world mindset. Students build confidence by producing small, functional units early in the process. The sprint cycle also reinforces best practices, including regular testing, iterative improvement, and agile planning.

This structure mirrors industry workflows, preparing students for collaborative development environments.
