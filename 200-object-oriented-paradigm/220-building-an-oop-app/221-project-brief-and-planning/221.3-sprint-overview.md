# 221.3 Sprint overview

### Sprint-based development

The Task Tracker app is developed in stages using a sprint-based workflow. Each sprint focuses on a small, manageable set of goals drawn from the project backlog. At the end of each sprint, the app should be functional, even if only partially complete. This approach encourages continuous testing, early feedback, and gradual improvement.

### What is a sprint?

A sprint is a short, fixed period of focused development work. During each sprint:

* A small number of user stories are selected from the backlog
* Features are designed, implemented, and tested
* Code is reviewed and refined
* Documentation is updated

Each sprint concludes with a brief review and planning session to determine the goals of the next sprint.

### Sprint structure used in this project

This project uses two main sprints, followed by a final refinement stage:

**Sprint 1: Core functionality**

* Design and implement the `Task` and `TaskManager` classes
* Create, store, and view task data
* Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
* Test and review core features

**Sprint 2: Feature extensions**

* Add filtering and sorting functionality
* Implement data persistence (save/load)
* Introduce categories or priorities
* Improve user feedback and validation

**Final sprint: Quality and refinement**

* Refactor code for readability and efficiency
* Add automated or structured testing
* Review and document the completed app

### Benefits of using sprints

The sprint structure keeps the project focused and achievable. It breaks the development into clear steps, encourages testing at every stage, and allows for changes and improvements along the way. Students gain experience in real-world development practices and build confidence by completing small working units.
