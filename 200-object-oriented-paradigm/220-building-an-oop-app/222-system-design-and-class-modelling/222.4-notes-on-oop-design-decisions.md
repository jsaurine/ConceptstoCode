# 222.4 Notes on OOP design decisions

### Abstraction

Abstraction involves identifying the essential features of an object while ignoring unimportant details. In this design, the `Task` class abstracts the concept of a task into attributes like title, description, due date, and status. Unnecessary complexities (such as visual formatting or file storage) are kept separate from the objectâ€™s core purpose.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit. Both `Task` and `TaskManager` encapsulate their own data and behaviour. The internal state of a task (e.g. whether it is complete) can only be changed by calling specific methods like `mark_complete()` or `mark_incomplete()`, not by accessing attributes directly from outside the class.

### Cohesion

Cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single class are. Each class in the Task Tracker app is highly cohesive:

* The `Task` class is only responsible for managing its own state and displaying its own data.
* The `TaskManager` is only responsible for managing the collection of tasks and coordinating actions across them.

High cohesion makes each class easier to test, debug, and extend.

### Separation of concerns

Separation of concerns ensures that different parts of the system have clearly defined roles. The app design separates:

* Task data (handled by `Task`)
* Task management (handled by `TaskManager`)
* User interaction (to be added in the main program logic)

This structure avoids mixing unrelated responsibilities and allows for flexible changes in future sprints.

### Extensibility

This design can easily be extended in later modules. For example:

* New attributes like `priority` or `category` can be added to the `Task` class
* Methods like `sort_by_due_date()` or `filter_by_category()` can be added to `TaskManager`
* Persistence features like saving to a file can be introduced without disrupting existing logic

These changes can be added incrementally by modifying one class at a time.
