# 222.2 Class design / TaskManager

### Role of the TaskManager class

The `TaskManager` class is responsible for coordinating and controlling the list of tasks. It provides a structured way to store, access, and manipulate multiple `Task` objects. While the `Task` class handles individual task behaviour, the `TaskManager` class handles the collection and interaction between tasks.

### Attributes

The `TaskManager` class uses a single instance attribute:

* `tasks`: a list that stores multiple `Task` objects

This list allows the program to keep track of all active tasks and iterate through them when performing operations like searching, displaying, or filtering.

### Methods

The `TaskManager` class provides the following behaviours:

* `add_task(task)` – adds a new Task object to the list
* `list_tasks()` – displays a summary of all tasks
* `find_task(title)` – searches for a task by title and returns the Task object
* `remove_task(title)` – removes a task from the list based on title
* `get_completed_tasks()` – returns a list of completed tasks
* `get_incomplete_tasks()` – returns a list of incomplete tasks
* `display_all_tasks()` – calls `display_details()` for each task

These methods support key user actions such as adding, viewing, and managing task progress.

### Sample interface

This sketch shows a basic version of the class and its interface:

```python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []

    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.append(task)

    def list_tasks(self):
        for task in self.tasks:
            task.display_summary()

    def find_task(self, title):
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task.title == title:
                return task
        return None

    def remove_task(self, title):
        task = self.find_task(title)
        if task:
            self.tasks.remove(task)

    def get_completed_tasks(self):
        return [task for task in self.tasks if task.is_complete]

    def get_incomplete_tasks(self):
        return [task for task in self.tasks if not task.is_complete]

    def display_all_tasks(self):
        for task in self.tasks:
            task.display_details()
```

### Notes on design

The `TaskManager` acts as a controller class that manages the lifecycle of `Task` objects. It separates user-level operations from individual object behaviour, supporting a clear and maintainable system structure. Additional features such as filtering, sorting, or saving tasks can be added to this class in future sprints.
