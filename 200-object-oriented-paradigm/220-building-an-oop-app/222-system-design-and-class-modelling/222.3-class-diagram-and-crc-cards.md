# 222.3 Class diagram and CRC cards

### Class diagram

The class diagram shows the relationship between the `Task` and `TaskManager` classes. It outlines their attributes and methods, giving a high-level overview of the object-oriented structure before implementation begins.

```
+---------------------+
|      Task           |
+---------------------+
| - title             |
| - description       |
| - due_date          |
| - is_complete       |
+---------------------+
| + mark_complete()   |
| + mark_incomplete() |
| + display_summary() |
| + display_details() |
+---------------------+

        used by

+-----------------------------+
|       TaskManager           |
+-----------------------------+
| - tasks (list of Task)      |
+-----------------------------+
| + add_task()                |
| + list_tasks()              |
| + find_task()               |
| + remove_task()             |
| + display_all_tasks()       |
| + get_incomplete_tasks()    |
| + get_completed_tasks()     |
+-----------------------------+
```

### CRC cards

CRC stands for _Class–Responsibility–Collaborator_. These cards serve as a planning tool to describe what each class is responsible for and with which other classes it interacts. Below are the CRC cards for this project.

#### Task

**Responsibilities**

* Store task data
* Report task details
* Update completion status

**Collaborators**

* TaskManager (calls methods on Task objects)

#### TaskManager

**Responsibilities**

* Store and manage a list of Task objects
* Add, find, and remove tasks
* Display lists of tasks based on user input

**Collaborators**

* Task (instantiates and manages instances)

### Notes on object interaction

The `TaskManager` acts as the controller, maintaining a list of `Task` objects and calling their methods as needed. This design keeps individual tasks simple and modular, while allowing the manager class to coordinate complex behaviours.
