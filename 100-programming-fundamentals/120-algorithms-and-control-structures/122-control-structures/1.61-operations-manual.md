# 1.61 Operations Manual

Control structures define the flow of logic in a program. They allow the computer to process instructions in a specific order, make decisions, or repeat tasks. Regardless of complexity, all algorithms rely on just three structures: sequence, selection, and repetition. Each can be used on its own or combined to model complex behaviour.

### Sequence

A sequence is a set of instructions executed one after the other. This is the default control structure and doesn’t involve any decision-making or repetition.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
INPUT username
OUTPUT "Welcome, " + username
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
username = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Welcome, {username}!)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Selection

Selection allows a program to choose between paths based on a condition. In Python, this is done with if, elif, and else.

#### Binary selection

Binary selection refers to a decision-making process where the program chooses between two possible paths based on a specified condition, typically using constructs like `if` and `else`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
IF age >= 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "You can vote."
ELSE
    OUTPUT "You are too young to vote."
ENDIF
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote.")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Multiway selection

Multiway selection allows a program to choose from multiple paths based on different conditions. In Python, this is achieved using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. Each `elif` provides an additional condition to evaluate, and the `else` serves as a catch-all for cases where none of the preceding conditions are met. This structure enables more complex decision-making processes when multiple criteria must be considered.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
BEGIN
    CASEWHERE
        grade >= 90 : OUTPUT "A"
        grade >= 80 : OUTPUT "B"
        grade >= 70 : OUTPUT "C"
        grade < 70 : "Needs improvement"
    ENDCASE
END
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("C")
else:
    print("Needs improvement")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Nested selection

Nested selection involves placing an `if` statement inside another `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement. This allows for more intricate decision-making processes by evaluating additional conditions only if the previous conditions are met. It provides a way to handle complex scenarios where decisions depend on multiple layers of conditions being satisfied.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
IF has_account THEN
    IF password_correct THEN
        OUTPUT "Access granted."
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "Wrong password."
    ENDIF
ELSE
    OUTPUT "No account found."
ENDIF
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
if has_account:
    if password_correct:
        print("Access granted.")
    else:
        print("Wrong password.")
else:
    print("No account found.")
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Repetition

Repetition allows a program to execute a block of code multiple times. Python supports several looping patterns.

#### Pre-test loop (WHILE)

A pre-test loop, such as the `while` loop in Python, evaluates the loop condition before executing the loop's body. If the condition is true, the loop's code block runs; if false, the loop terminates. This makes it useful for scenarios where the number of iterations depends on a condition evaluated at each start of the loop.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
SET count TO 0
WHILE count < 5
    OUTPUT "Count is", count
    SET count TO count + 1
ENDWHILE
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
while True:
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    if password == "admin":
        break
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Post-test loop (REPEAT/UNTIL)

A post-test loop evaluates the loop condition after executing the code block. It ensures that the loop's body runs at least once before checking the condition, making it suitable for situations where the operations must occur at least once, regardless of the condition.

Python doesn’t support `repeat-until` directly, but we simulate it using `while True` and `break`.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
REPEAT
    INPUT password
UNTIL password = "admin"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
while True:
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    if password == "admin":
        break
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Counted loop (FOR)

A counted loop, often implemented using a `for` loop, is a loop that iterates a specific number of times. It is ideal for situations where the number of iterations is known beforehand. In Python, a `for` loop is commonly used with the `range()` function to control the number of times the loop executes.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    OUTPUT "Round", i
NEXT i
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Round", i)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Combining structures

Control structures can be combined in any order. A loop might contain a selection; a selection might depend on the outcome of a previous loop.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
FOR i = 0 TO 2 STEP 1
    INPUT name
    IF name = "" THEN
        OUTPUT "Blank name entered. Skipping..."
        CONTINUE
    ENDIF
    OUTPUT "Hello", name
NEXT i
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
for i in range(0, 3, 1):
    name = input("Enter name: ")
    if name == "":
        print("Blank name entered. Skipping...")
        continue
    print("Hello", name)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Key concepts

* **Sequence** executes instructions in order.
* **Selection** uses conditions to choose a path (if, elif, else).
* **Repetition** runs instructions multiple times (while, for, repeat-until).
* **Control structures** can be nested or combined.
* `break` exits a loop early; `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration.
