# 1.62 Training

## Training: Practising control structures

This hands-on activity builds confidence and fluency with control structures before completing the Simulation or Clearance tasks.

### Purpose

This training lab supports your development of the three foundational control structures used in programming. The tasks focus on writing clear logic, using pseudocode, and translating ideas into working Python code.

You will:

* Write pseudocode for common logic patterns
* Practise writing `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, and `for` structures in Python
* Combine logic in nested and multi-part structures
* Reflect on when to apply each control structure

### Accessing the notebook

You can access the training notebook directly from our GitHub repository:\
[⬇ Download the training notebook](https://github.com/Emanuel-School/160-control-structures/blob/main/162-training.ipynb)

You can either:

* Download the `.ipynb` file and open it in JupyterLab, PyCHarm, VS Code, etc.
* Clone the repository to your local machine and work inside your own GitHub repo
* Use an online Jupyter environment like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the notebook in your browser

### Learning goals

In this training lab, you will:

* Practise writing algorithms using pseudocode and Python
* Recognise and correctly apply sequence, binary selection, multi-way selection, and loops
* Translate logical plans into working Python code
* Prepare for writing combined structures and nested logic in later activities

### Suggestions for success

* Refer to the [**Operations Manual**](1.61-operations-manual.md) when you're unsure about syntax or logic
* Use markdown cells to write your pseudocode clearly before coding
* Use `Run All` in Jupyter to test whether your logic flows correctly
* Don’t just get it working — ask yourself _why_ it works
* Save your changes in your repository and reflect on your progress
