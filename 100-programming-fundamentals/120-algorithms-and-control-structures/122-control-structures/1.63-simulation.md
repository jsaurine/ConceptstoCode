# 1.63 Simulation

### Purpose

The simulation challenges students to:

* Decompose a larger problem into logical steps
* Write precise pseudocode and visualise logic with flowcharts
* Implement combined control structures in Python
* Reflect on their design, testing, and problem-solving process

### Scenario

Students will design a **menu-based virtual vending machine** that:

* Displays at least three item choices
* Allows the user to select, confirm, or cancel a purchase
* Loops until the user chooses to exit

This task requires multi-way selection and looping structures.

### Accessing the simulation notebook

Students can download the simulation notebook directly from the repository:

[â¬‡ Download the simulation notebook](https://github.com/Emanuel-School/160-control-structures/blob/main/163-simulation.ipynb)

They should work in JupyterLab, VS Code, or another `.ipynb`-compatible editor, completing all sections.

### Learning outcomes

By completing this simulation, students will:

* Apply pseudocode and flowcharting to plan a program
* Implement Python code using sequence, selection, and repetition
* Handle user input and invalid selections robustly
* Reflect on the design and testing process to improve future work

### Submission

Students should submit:

* Completed `.ipynb` file with all sections filled out
* Any attached or linked flowchart images
* Commit and push their work to their personal repository
