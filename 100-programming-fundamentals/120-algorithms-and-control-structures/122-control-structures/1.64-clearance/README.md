# 1.64 Clearance

This activity helps you check your mastery of **sequence**, **selection**, and **repetition** by answering 15 open-response questions. If you can answer them confidently without referring to notes, you can be sure you've internalised the key skills. Your written responses will also serve as valuable notes for your exam preparation.

### Purpose

By completing this activity, you will:

* Apply knowledge and understanding of control structures
* Apply your understanding through written reflection and small coding challenges
* Build a personal bank of notes you can reuse for revision
