# 1.65 Mission

This project brings together all the skills you’ve developed so far, including control structures, planning with pseudocode, and writing clear, maintainable code.

### Purpose

This Mission challenges you to:

* Combine sequence, selection, and repetition in a meaningful way
* Plan a working program using pseudocode and/or flowcharts
* Write a complete Python application with user interaction and scoring
* Reflect on your design, testing, and improvements

### Learning goals

By completing this Mission, you will:

* Design a program that presents questions and checks user responses
* Use loops, conditionals, and variables to track progress and scoring
* Apply structured design principles to organise your code clearly
* Test your program with different user inputs and edge cases
* Build confidence in completing a holistic coding project

### Task overview

Your goal is to develop a **simple quiz or flashcard app** that:

* Presents at least five predefined questions to the user
* Accepts user input as answers
* Tracks the number of correct answers
* Gives immediate feedback after each question
* Displays the final score at the end
* Offers the option to replay or exit

### Requirements

Your program must:

* Use at least one loop to repeat questions
* Use selection (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to check answers and provide feedback
* Use sequence to control the overall flow
* Be implemented in a Python `.py` file, not a notebook
* Include comments explaining key parts of your code

Optional extensions:

* Randomise the order of questions
* Load questions from an external file (e.g., `questions.txt`)
* Allow the user to add new questions interactively
* Keep a record of scores across runs

### Submission instructions

1. Clone or download the Mission folder from GitHub:\
   [⬇ Download the starter project](https://github.com/Emanuel-School/160-control-structures/blob/main/165-mission.ipynb)
2. Work locally on your `.py` file using your preferred editor (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.).
3. Test your program thoroughly.
4. Commit and push your final version to your own repository.

### Reflection

Along with your code, you should prepare a short written reflection:

* What worked well in your design?
* What challenges did you face, and how did you solve them?
* How did you test your program?
* What improvements or extensions would you add if you had more time?
