# Lab 2 / Flowcharts to Python

### Learning objectives

* Interpret branching and looping logic in flowcharts
* Use condition-controlled loops (WHILE) and exception handling

### Flowchart

### Instructions

1. Analyse the file `binary_search_flowchart.png` and
2. Do a dry run of the algorithm and create trace tables for the following test cases:

* \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
* \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
* \[G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P]
* \[blue, brown, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow]

3. Write a Python program that implements the logic described in the flowchart.
4. Test your program with the test cases provided above.
