# 1.72 Training

### Instructions

In this microlab, you'll practise turning problem descriptions into structured pseudocode using a top-down approach. You'll create a mainline and decompose tasks into named subroutines. Complete your work in the Jupyter notebook provided below.

You should refer to the [Manual](1.71-operations-manual.md) for this topic if you get stuck.

### Tasks

1. Open the Jupyter notebook linked below.
2. Complete the following:
   * Identify the required input, output, and logic steps for each scenario.
   * Write a mainline pseudocode structure using subprogram names.
   * Refine at least one subroutine in more detail.
   * Include a desk check table for one of your solutions.

### Examples

Sample problems in the notebook include:

* A library overdue notice generator
* A basic password validator
* A temperature converter with input checking

### Reflection

Once complete, consider:

* Did you repeat logic across subroutines?
* Was your mainline logic easy to follow?
* How did desk checking help you refine your algorithm?

Submit your notebook to your personal GitHub repo and update your progress tracker.
