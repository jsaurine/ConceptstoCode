# 1.73 Simulation

### Purpose

This Simulation helps you:

* Apply decomposition and stepwise refinement
* Use pseudocode to plan a solution
* Implement a working program using control structures
* Reflect on your design process and testing

### Learning goals

By completing this Simulation, you will:

* Practise writing and applying pseudocode (with BEGIN and END)
* Use loops, conditions, and variables effectively
* Develop a program that checks multiple conditions
* Evaluate and improve your program based on testing

### Task summary

You are challenged to design and implement a program that:

* Asks the user to enter a password
* Checks:
  * Minimum length (8 characters)
  * At least one digit
  * At least one uppercase letter
* Provides feedback and allows up to 3 attempts

### Submission

Submit:

* Your completed `.py` file
* Your pseudocode (in comments or as a separate file)
* A short reflection on your design, challenges, and improvements
