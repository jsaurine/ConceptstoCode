# 1.75 Mission

### Purpose

This Mission challenges you to:

* Apply top-down and bottom-up design techniques
* Use decomposition, abstraction, and modular design
* Write clear pseudocode (with BEGIN and END) to guide your implementation
* Build a working Python program using control structures, loops, and functions
* Test your solution and reflect on improvements

### Learning goals

By completing this Mission, you will:

* Design and implement a multi-part program with reusable components
* Handle user input, selection, and score tracking
* Integrate control structures effectively in a real-world scenario
* Build confidence in developing, testing, and improving a complete software solution

### Task overview

Your Mission is to build a **category-based quiz app** that:

* Lets the user select a category (e.g., general knowledge, maths)
* Asks at least five questions from the selected category
* Tracks the user’s score
* Provides feedback after each question and at the end
* Allows the user to play again or exit

Optional extensions:

* Load questions from an external file
* Randomise question order
* Add a timer or scoring bonuses

### Submission

Submit:

* Your completed `.py` file
* Your pseudocode (with BEGIN and END), included as comments or a separate file
* A short reflection on:
  * How you designed and structured your program
  * Challenges you faced and how you overcame them
  * Improvements you would add if you had more time
