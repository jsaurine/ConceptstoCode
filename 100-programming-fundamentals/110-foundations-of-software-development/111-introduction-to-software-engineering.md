### Software development process

Software development is a structured process that transforms an initial concept into a fully functional software solution. This process follows a series of defined stages, ensuring that software is designed, implemented, tested, and maintained effectively. The development lifecycle begins with identifying requirements, where developers work with stakeholders to determine the software’s purpose, features, and constraints. Specifications are then established to guide the design phase, in which software architects create detailed plans for the system’s structure, including data flow, algorithms, and user interfaces. Development follows, where programmers write and assemble code, integrating various components to build the software. Testing is a crucial stage, verifying that the software functions correctly and meets design expectations before it is installed and deployed for users.

### Stages in software development

Beyond the initial release, software must be maintained to ensure its ongoing functionality, security, and performance. Maintenance includes fixing bugs, updating features, and improving efficiency in response to user feedback and evolving technology. Different methodologies guide the software development process, with some, like the Waterfall model, following a linear, structured approach, while others, like Agile, embrace flexibility and continuous iteration. These approaches influence how teams collaborate, manage risk, and adapt to changing requirements. Whether developing a large-scale enterprise system or a small mobile app, software engineering principles ensure that each phase of development is carefully planned and executed to create reliable, effective, and user-friendly software.
