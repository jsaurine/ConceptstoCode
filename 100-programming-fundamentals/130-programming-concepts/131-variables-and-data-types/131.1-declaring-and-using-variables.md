# 131.1 Declaring and using variables

### **What is a variable?**

A variable is a **named container** for data. It allows a program to store, reference, and update information in memory. By using variables, you can make your code flexible and reusable.

### **Declaring a variable**

Different programming languages have different rules for declaring variables. In pseudocode, we often declare a variable with an explicit `SET` statement. In Python, variables are created when a value is first assigned.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
SET name TO "Myles"
SET age TO 16
SET is_student TO TRUE
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
name = "Myles"
age = 16
is_student = True
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **Naming rules and conventions**

**Rules** (apply to most languages, including Python):

* Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore.
* They cannot contain spaces or punctuation (except `_`).
* Reserved keywords (like `IF`, `FOR`, `WHILE`) cannot be used as names.

**Good conventions**

* Use lowercase and underscores for readability: `user_score`, `first_name`.
* Choose names that describe what the variable stores: `temperature` instead of `x`.

### **Changing values**

Variables can be updated during a program's execution. When you assign a new value, it replaces the old one.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
SET score TO 10
SET score TO score + 5
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
score = 10
score = score + 5
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **Using multiple variables**

You can use multiple variables to break down a problem and store intermediate values.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
SET length TO 20  
SET width TO 5  
SET area TO length * width
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
length = 20
width = 5
area = length * width
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **Memory and data types**

Even though Python doesn't require you to declare a variable’s type, the **data type still matters**. When you assign a value, Python decides its type behind the scenes (string, integer, Boolean, etc.).

You don’t always need to declare types in pseudocode, either, but you should be clear about what data each variable holds.

### Key concepts

* A variable stores a value that can change.
* Variable names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions.
* Values can be read, written, and updated using variables.
* Each variable holds a value of a particular type.
