# 131.3 Constants and naming conventions

### **What is a constant?**

A **constant** is a value that does not change while the program runs. Using constants makes code **more readable**, **easier to maintain**, and helps prevent accidental changes to important values.

Constants are often used for:

* Screen dimensions
* Player speed
* Configuration values
* Limits or thresholds

### **Declaring constants**

Python does not have true constants, but programmers use **uppercase variable names** to signal that a value should not be changed.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudocode" %}
```
SET SCREEN_WIDTH TO 800
SET SCREEN_HEIGHT TO 600
SET MAX_HEALTH TO 100
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
MAX_HEALTH = 100
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Even though Python doesn’t enforce it, **treating these as fixed values** is part of good practice.

### **Why use constants?**

In this example below, the player width should always be half the screen width.

Without constants:

```python
player_x = 400
screen_width = 400  # Mistake! Should be 800, but the value was reused incorrectly
```

With constants:

```python
player_x = SCREEN_WIDTH // 2
```

Benefits:

* Makes code self-documenting
* Reduces “magic numbers” (unexplained hard-coded values)
* Simplifies future updates — just change the constant in one place

### **Naming conventions**

To keep code readable, follow these **standard naming styles**:

* **Constants:** ALL\_CAPS with underscores\
  Example: `MAX_SPEED`, `DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE`
* **Variables (Python):** `snake_case`\
  Example: `user_score`, `player_position`
* **Class names (Python):** `CamelCase`\
  Example: `GameScreen`, `PlayerStats`
* **Booleans:** Use names that start with `is_`, `has_`, or `can_`\
  Example: `is_visible`, `has_lives_left`, `can_jump`

### **Reserved words**

Avoid using keywords reserved by the programming language. These include:

* `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`
* `class`, `def`, `True`, `False`

These words have special meanings and will cause syntax errors if used as variable names.

### Key concepts

* A **constant** is a named value that does not change during execution.
* Using named constants improves **clarity** and **maintainability**.
* Naming conventions help make code consistent and professional.
* Reserved words should not be used as variable names.
