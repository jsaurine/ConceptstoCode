# 131.3 Records

### Outline

In this topic, we introduce recordsâ€”a data structure that allows you to group related data under one name using named fields. Records are instrumental when storing multiple attributes about the same object, such as a user or a product.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Understand what a record is and how it differs from lists or arrays
* Define records using dictionaries or classes in Python
* Store and access multiple fields of different types under a single data item
* Use records to structure data in more meaningful ways for real-world problems

### Glossary

| Term               | Definition                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Record**         | A data structure that stores related fields under one entity, often with different data types           |
| **Field**          | An individual attribute in a record, e.g. `name`, `age`, `email`                                        |
| **Key-value pair** | A way of storing data where each key (field name) maps to a specific value                              |
| **Dictionary**     | A Python data structure often used to represent records with keys and values                            |
| **Class**          | A Python structure that defines a new data type (used in object-oriented programming to create records) |

### Overview

A **record** groups together values that belong to one object or entity. These values can be of different data types. For example, a record representing a student might include a name (string), age (integer), and enrolled status (Boolean).

In other languages, records are sometimes called structs or objects. In Python, you can implement records using **dictionaries** (for quick prototyping) or **classes** (for more structured design).

### Records using dictionaries

In Python, dictionaries are ideal for creating simple records.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Aria",
    "age": 17,
    "enrolled": True
}
```

You can access fields using their names:

```python
print(student["name"])      # Output: Aria
print(student["enrolled"])  # Output: True
```

You can update fields:

```python
student["age"] = 18
```

And add new ones:

```python
student["grade"] = "A"
```

### Records using classes

For larger programs or when structure and type checking matter, we define records using classes.

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age, enrolled):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.enrolled = enrolled

s1 = Student("Aria", 17, True)
print(s1.name)  # Output: Aria
```

This approach allows you to create multiple instances and ensures consistency in how data is organised.

### Lists of records

You can store multiple records in a list. This is useful for managing collections of data, such as student or employee records.

```python
students = [
    {"name": "Aria", "age": 17},
    {"name": "Liam", "age": 16},
    {"name": "Zoe", "age": 17}
]

for student in students:
    print(student["name"], student["age"])
```

### When to use records

Use records when:

* You need to group different types of data under a common heading
* Your data has named fields (like name, age, height)
* You want to organise information logically for readability and maintainability

### Key concepts

* A record is a structured way of grouping related data fields
* Dictionaries and classes in Python can be used to implement records
* Records are more expressive than lists when data has named fields
* Lists of records allow for scalable, structured storage of complex data
