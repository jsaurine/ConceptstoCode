# 135.5 Version control in a development workflow

### Why use version control in real projects?

Version control isn’t just about saving code. It supports a **structured, trackable workflow** where developers can:

* Break large tasks into smaller units
* Work on different features at the same time
* Review and test changes before merging them
* Track who did what, when, and why

This is essential in collaborative and Agile development environments.

### Git in an Agile workflow

In Agile projects, work is divided into **sprints**, and tasks are drawn from a **project backlog**. Version control tools like Git support this by:

* Creating **branches** for each task or user story
* Making frequent, small **commits** with meaningful messages
* Using **pull requests** to review and approve work before merging
* Tagging commits to mark **milestones** or **release versions**

#### Example workflow

1. **Pull latest changes** from the `main` branch
2.  **Create a branch** for your sprint task:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix-bug-32
    ```
3. **Create a pull request** on GitHub to merge into `main`
4. **Peer review** and **merge**, resolving conflicts if needed
5. **Delete branch** after successful merge

This cycle repeats for each task in the sprint.

### Writing meaningful commit messages

A good commit message tells others (and your future self) what changed and why.

* ✔ `Add function to validate user input`
* ✔ `Fix bug: prevent crash when file is missing`
* ✘ `update`
* ✘ `stuff`

Best practice:

```bash
git commit -m "Brief summary in present tense"
```

Use `git log` to review your history. Your future project reviews and testing logs will thank you.

### Version tagging and releases

Tags are used to mark specific versions or releases of your software.

```bash
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
```

Use tags when you:

* Complete a major feature set
* Prepare for a demo or handover
* Mark a backup before refactoring

### Peer review and collaboration

On platforms like GitHub, **pull requests** are used to review code before it’s merged. Reviewers can:

* Add comments
* Suggest improvements
* Approve or block changes

This encourages quality control and shared understanding of the codebase.

### Summary

* Git supports Agile workflows by allowing branching, tracking, and collaboration.
* Developers commit often, push regularly, and merge via pull requests.
* Good commit messages and tagging help with documentation and version history.
* Version control isn’t just about saving code—it’s about supporting teamwork, review, and reliability.

In the next topic, you’ll complete a practical challenge to use Git across an entire mini-project workflow, from setup to merge.
