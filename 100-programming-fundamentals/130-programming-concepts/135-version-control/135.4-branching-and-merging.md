# 135.4 Branching and merging

### What is a branch?

A **branch** is a separate line of development in a Git repository. It allows you to make changes without affecting the `main` version of your project.

Branches are commonly used to:

* Build new features
* Fix bugs
* Try out ideas
* Work on different tasks without interfering with each other

Every Git repository starts with a default branch called `main`.

You can create a new branch to work on something independently, then merge it back into `main` when it’s ready.

### Why use branches?

Using branches keeps your main codebase clean and stable.

For example:

* You create a branch called `feature-login`
* You build and test the login feature
* Once it’s working, you **merge** it into `main`

If something goes wrong, the rest of your code isn’t affected.

This process also supports collaboration, as multiple team members can work on their own branches simultaneously.

### Common Git branch commands

```bash
git branch                      # List all branches
git branch new-feature         # Create a new branch
git checkout new-feature       # Switch to that branch
git switch new-feature         # (Alternative modern command)
git merge new-feature          # Merge branch into current one
```

A typical branching timeline might look like this:

```
main:     A──B─────E────F
                 \     
feature:           C────D
```

* A and B are commits on `main`
* You branch off to `feature`, adding commits C and D
* When the feature is complete, you merge it back into `main`, creating commits E and F

### Merging and merge conflicts

When you merge one branch into another, Git attempts to combine the changes automatically. If both branches edited the same part of a file, you get a **merge conflict**.

Git will mark the conflict in the file like this:

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
print("Hello from main")
=======
print("Hello from feature branch")
>>>>>>> feature
```

You must resolve the conflict manually, then add and commit the resolved file.

#### Example merge steps:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
# If there's a conflict:
# 1. Open the file and fix the conflict
# 2. git add resolved_file.py
# 3. git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### Deleting a branch

Once a feature has been merged, you can delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature-branch
```

This keeps your workspace clean.

### Summary

* A **branch** lets you work on a task without affecting the main project.
* You can **merge** branches once the work is complete.
* **Merge conflicts** happen when the same part of a file is changed in two branches.
* Branching and merging are essential for collaborative and safe software development.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to apply version control within a larger workflow, using Git to support Agile project development.
