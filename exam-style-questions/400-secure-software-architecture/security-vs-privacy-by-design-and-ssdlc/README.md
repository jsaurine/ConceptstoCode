# Security vs Privacy by Design and SSDLC

### Organising your thinking

Before writing your response, complete the table below. It will help you identify how **privacy by design** and **security by design** apply at each stage of the SSDLC.

You should understand:

* What privacy and security concerns arise at each phase
* How they are addressed differently
* Where trade-offs or overlap might occur

#### Activity: Mapping privacy by design (PbD) and security by design (SbD) across the secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)

| **Stage**         | **PbD issues to address** | **PbD example(s)** | **SbyD issues to address** | **SbyD example(s)** |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| User Requirements |                           |                    |                            |                     |
| System Design     |                           |                    |                            |                     |
| Development       |                           |                    |                            |                     |
| Testing           |                           |                    |                            |                     |
| Maintenance       |                           |                    |                            |                     |

### Practice extended-response question (6 marks)

**Question:**

> Discuss how privacy by design and security by design are applied at different stages of the secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC).\
> In your response, refer to at least two different stages and provide specific examples.
