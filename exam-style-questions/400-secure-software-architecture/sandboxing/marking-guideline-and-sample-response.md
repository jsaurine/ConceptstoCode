### Sample response

Sandboxing supports the system design stage of the SSDLC by enforcing **security by design** â€” isolating untrusted or potentially risky components to prevent them from compromising the wider system. In this stage, developers make architectural decisions that determine how software modules interact, what resources they can access, and how failures are contained.

For example, a system might be designed so that third-party plug-ins run in a restricted environment where they cannot access sensitive files or memory. This supports the security goals of confidentiality by preventing data leaks and integrity by stopping unauthorised modification of core system data.

Sandboxing also contributes to **authorisation**, because it limits what permissions or APIs an isolated module can access, and to **availability**, because faults in one sandboxed area are less likely to crash the entire application. By embedding these constraints at the design level, sandboxing helps ensure the system remains secure, resilient, and accountable.
