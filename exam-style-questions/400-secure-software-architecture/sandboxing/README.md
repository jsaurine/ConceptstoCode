# Sandboxing

### Organise your ideas

Complete the table below to help plan your response. Use dot points to describe how sandboxing might support each of the following security goals in the **design stage** of the secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC).

| **Security concept** | **How sandboxing helps** |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Confidentiality      |                          |
| Integrity            |                          |
| Availability         |                          |
| Authorisation        |                          |
| Accountability       |                          |

Tip: Think about how **isolating risky components** protects sensitive data, prevents corruption, and limits unauthorised access.
