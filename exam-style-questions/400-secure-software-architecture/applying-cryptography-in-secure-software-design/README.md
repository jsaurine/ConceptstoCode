# Applying cryptography in secure software design

## Structuring prompt

Before answering the question, brainstorm examples of where cryptographic techniques might support these security goals in a system:

| **Design goal**       | **How cryptography supports it** |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Data protection       |                                  |
| Regulatory compliance |                                  |
| Security by design    |                                  |
| Privacy               |                                  |

Examples to consider:

* Password hashing
* HTTPS
* Encrypted file storage
* Digital signatures
* API key validation
