# Preface

This textbook, _Concepts to Code:  Software Engineering Foundations_, provides a comprehensive guide to Year 11 and 12 Software Engineering. It covers secure software architecture, web programming, automation, and the development of a complete software engineering project. The content is crafted to build foundational skills and knowledge that students can directly apply, blending theory with practical coding exercises and project work.

This resource aligns closely with the New South Wales HSC Software Engineering syllabus. Each chapter is mapped to specific syllabus content to help students and educators navigate the course requirements effectively. This textbook will give students the skills and confidence to design, develop, and evaluate software solutions that meet security, ethical, and performance standards.

I hope this book will become a valuable tool for students and educators, providing clear, structured insights into the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering.

### Syllabus alignment

This text is aligned with the [NSW Curriculum syllabus for HSC Software Engineering](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/tas/software-engineering-11-12-2022/overview). The course content is woven together in a meaningful sequence rather than teaching and learning each module as a discrete unit. This approach reflects the interconnected nature of modern software engineering. Students will encounter principles from secure software architecture, web programming, automation, and project development throughout the course, reinforcing the relevance of each skill within a real-world context. This approach enables students to build on foundational concepts progressively, applying knowledge across multiple domains to create secure, effective software solutions.

### Updates

This e-textbook is part of a dynamic and evolving set of resources the author prepares before teaching concepts from the new Software Engineering course. As content is refined and new sections are written, additional materials will be published online, ensuring that students and educators can access up-to-date material. Each chapter is indexed for easy discovery, making this book a continually expanding tool for learning and teaching the entire Year 12 Software Engineering course.
