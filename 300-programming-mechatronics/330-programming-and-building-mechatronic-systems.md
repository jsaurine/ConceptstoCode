# 330 Programming and building mechatronic systems

### Overview

This chapter guides students through the development and testing of complete mechatronic solutions. Building on their earlier work, students integrate sensors, actuators, and interfaces using structured Python code on the Raspberry Pi. Emphasis is placed on closed-loop control, user interfaces, and performance testing.

### Targets

In this chapter, students learn to:

* Build and test a real-world mechatronic prototype
* Write functional code to control system components
* Implement a closed-loop control algorithm
* Design and test a user interface for interaction
* Evaluate system performance using unit tests and feedback
