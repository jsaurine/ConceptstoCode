# 310 Understanding mechatronic systems

### Overview

This chapter introduces the components and principles that underpin mechatronic systems. Students explore how hardware and software interact through the integration of microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and physical constraints. The Raspberry Pi serves as the core platform throughout this module. Systems thinking, data flow, and real-world design considerations are key themes.

### Targets

In this chapter, students learn to:

* Identify the major components of mechatronic systems
* Understand how hardware architecture influences software design
* Describe how sensors, actuators, and control structures work together
* Analyse wiring, power, and data needs in physical systems
* Explore how mechatronics addresses real-world accessibility and design constraints
