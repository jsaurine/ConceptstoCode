# 311 Applications of mechatronics

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how mechatronic systems combine sensing, control, and actuation to solve problems in real-world environments. Students examine how these systems are applied in areas such as manufacturing, medicine, aerospace, agriculture, and assistive technology. The aim is to understand the breadth of the field and begin identifying components common to all mechatronic systems.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Identify industries and systems that use mechatronic design
* Describe how sensors, actuators, and control algorithms are combined in real-world products
* Recognise the problem-solving purpose of mechatronic systems in context
* Begin thinking critically about how such systems are engineered to meet specific user needs

**Understanding mechatronic hardware and software**

* Outline applications of mechatronic systems in a variety of specialised fields

### What is a mechatronic system?

A mechatronic system integrates:

* **Sensors** to collect data
* **Control logic** (typically a microcontroller or CPU) to process data
* **Actuators or end-effectors** to respond physically

These systems are designed to automate tasks, adapt to environmental input, and improve performance, safety, or convenience.

### Common applications

#### 1. **Manufacturing and robotics**

* Industrial robot arms (e.g. used in automotive assembly)
* CNC machines
* Automated pick-and-place systems

#### 2. **Healthcare and rehabilitation**

* Prosthetic limbs with EMG sensors
* Surgical robots (e.g. Da Vinci robot)
* Smart pill dispensers and infusion pumps

#### 3. **Agriculture**

* Autonomous tractors and planters
* Environmental sensing for crop management
* Automated irrigation systems

#### 4. **Aerospace and defence**

* Drone flight control systems
* Robotic surveillance or bomb disposal units
* Satellite orientation mechanisms

#### 5. **Assistive and accessibility devices**

* Wheelchairs with joystick or sip-puff control
* Voice-activated smart home systems
* Robotic arms for accessibility

### Real-world example: Self-parking car

A self-parking car integrates:

* **Ultrasonic sensors** to detect obstacles
* **Microcontrollers** that calculate steering angles and distances
* **Electric motors** to control the steering and throttle
* **User interface** (buttons or touchscreen) for control

This is a classic closed-loop system, where the car responds in real time to sensor feedback to complete a task autonomously.

### Summary

Mechatronic systems are everywhere — from medical devices to cars, farms, and factories. They combine sensing, logic, and motion to solve real-world problems. Understanding how these systems work in context helps us design our own solutions that are purposeful, efficient, and innovative.

### Activities

Use the information on this page and your own online research to complete the tasks below.

#### **Task 1 – Define it**

1. In your own words, what is a mechatronic system?
2. What three components are common to all mechatronic systems?

#### **Task 2 – Explore the field**

Match each application to its primary components:

| Application             | Sensor(s) | Actuator(s) | Controller |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Prosthetic limb         |           |             |            |
| Drone stabilisation     |           |             |            |
| Smart irrigation system |           |             |            |
| Robotic vacuum          |           |             |            |

**Task 3 – Research task**

Choose one mechatronic system from the list below or find your own example.

* Describe its purpose
* Identify the sensor(s), actuator(s), and controller it uses
* Explain how it improves a task or solves a problem

#### Options:

* Smart prosthetic
* Autonomous vehicle
* Warehouse robot
* Exoskeleton
* Drone
* Something else?

#### **Task 4 – Discussion**

Do you think mechatronic systems should always replace human roles? Why or why not?
