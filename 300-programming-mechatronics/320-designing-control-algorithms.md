# 320 Designing control algorithms

### Overview

This chapter focuses on algorithm design within a mechatronic context. Students learn to write structured, testable algorithms that process sensor input, make decisions, and control actuators. They distinguish between open and closed-loop systems, and practise developing Python-based control logic using feedback and constraints.

### Targets

In this chapter, students learn to:

* Write structured control algorithms using decision logic
* Implement open and closed-loop control in code
* Use sensor feedback to refine actuator behaviour
* Analyse the features of autonomous systems
* Transition from pseudocode to Python implementation
