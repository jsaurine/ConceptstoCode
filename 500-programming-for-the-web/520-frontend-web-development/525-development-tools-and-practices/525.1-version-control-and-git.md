# 525.1 Version control and Git

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how developers use **version control systems** to manage changes in their code. Version control allows teams to track progress, roll back mistakes, and collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Students are introduced to **Git**, the most widely used version control tool, and how it integrates with online platforms like GitHub.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the purpose and benefits of version control
* Use Git to track changes in a project
* Understand key Git commands such as `add`, `commit`, and `push`
* Create and manage repositories locally and on GitHub
* Collaborate by pulling updates and resolving conflicts

**Designing web applications**

* Investigate the reasons for version control and apply it when developing web application

### What is version control?

**Version control** is a system that tracks changes to code over time. It allows developers to:

* View the history of edits
* Restore earlier versions if needed
* Work on features without affecting the main project
* Merge contributions from multiple collaborators

Without version control, itâ€™s difficult to manage files and code changes, especially in team environments.

### What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system used by developers to:

* Record changes to files
* Create snapshots of a project (called commits)
* Share and combine code using branches and merges

Each developer has a full copy of the project history on their machine, making Git fast and resilient.

### Git basics: a typical workflow

1.  **Initialise a repository**

    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  **Stage changes**

    ```bash
    git add filename
    ```
3.  **Commit changes**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add login form"
    ```
4.  **Push to GitHub (or another remote)**

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

### Collaboration with GitHub

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows developers to:

* Share projects publicly or privately
* Use issues and pull requests to manage contributions
* Fork and clone other repositories
* Collaborate across locations using a shared online codebase

Students often begin by cloning a starter repository, creating branches, and submitting changes.

### Summary

Version control is essential in modern software development. Git provides the tools to track, manage, and merge changes efficiently. Paired with platforms like GitHub, version control supports individual progress and team collaboration, making projects more organised, recoverable, and scalable.
