# 525.2 CMS and open source tools

### Overview

In this topic, we explore the role of **Content Management Systems (CMS)** and **open source software** in modern web development. Students learn how CMS platforms simplify the creation and management of websites, and how open source tools contribute to productivity, flexibility, and community-driven innovation. Professionals widely use these systems and provide accessible pathways for developing and maintaining web applications.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Define what a CMS is and identify common examples
* Explain how CMS platforms are used to build and manage websites
* Identify the benefits and challenges of using open-source tools
* Understand the role of community, licensing, and contribution in open source development
* Evaluate when to use a CMS or custom development based on project needs

**Designing web applications**

* Research, experiment with and evaluate the prevalence and use of web content management systems (CMS)
* Explain the use and development of open-source software in relation to web development

### What is a CMS?

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is a platform that allows users to create, update, and manage website content without directly writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Popular CMS platforms include:

* **WordPress** – the most widely used CMS globally
* **Wix** and **Squarespace** – drag-and-drop web builders
* **Drupal** and **Joomla** – flexible, open-source CMS options

CMS platforms often include:

* Templates and themes
* Page editors
* Media management
* Plugin systems
* User access controls

### Benefits of using a CMS

* **Non-technical users** can manage content
* **Faster setup** than hand-coded websites
* **Extensible features** via plugins
* **Responsive templates** for mobile compatibility
* **Multi-user support** for teams and organisations

CMS platforms allow users to manage website content through a visual interface, without writing code.

### What is open source software?

**Open source software** is software with publicly available source code. Developers are free to inspect, modify, and contribute to the code under a licence (e.g. MIT, GPL).

In web development, open source tools include:

* **Code libraries** (e.g. jQuery, React)
* **Frameworks** (e.g. Flask, Django, Laravel)
* **CMS platforms** (e.g. WordPress, Drupal)
* **Utilities** (e.g. Bootstrap, VS Code extensions)

Benefits:

* **Community support** and documentation
* **Transparency and security** through peer review
* **Faster development** through reusable components
* **No cost** to use or distribute (in most cases)

Challenges:

* May lack formal support
* Projects can be abandoned
* Licensing may require attribution or code sharing

### When to use CMS vs custom development

| Use a CMS when...                   | Use custom code when...                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| The site has mostly static content  | You need custom functionality or design     |
| Non-developers will manage the site | Performance or security is a key concern    |
| Time and cost are limited           | You want full control over logic and layout |

### Summary

Content Management Systems simplify web development by providing visual tools for building and updating websites. Open source software fuels innovation and collaboration, offering flexible and affordable tools for developers. Together, CMS platforms and open source libraries form a key part of the modern web development toolkit.
