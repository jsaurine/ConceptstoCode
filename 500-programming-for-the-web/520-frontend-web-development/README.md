# 520 Frontend web development

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts and technologies used in front-end web development. It explores how HTML provides the structure, CSS defines the presentation, and JavaScript enables interactivity. A strong understanding of these technologies is essential for developing responsive, accessible, and engaging web applications.

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

• Describe the fundamental structure of webpages using HTML.

• Apply styling and layout techniques using CSS, including responsive design principles.

• Implement interactivity using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM).

• Evaluate and apply accessibility standards in web design.

• Integrate APIs and external data sources into front-end applications.

### Overview

The front-end of a web application is the layer that users interact with, combining structure, style, and functionality to create engaging experiences. HTML provides the foundation by structuring content, while CSS defines how elements are presented, allowing for custom layouts, colours, and typography. JavaScript extends this functionality by enabling dynamic interactions, such as responding to user input, modifying content in real-time, and fetching data from external sources. Together, these technologies form the backbone of modern front-end development, supporting both static and interactive applications.

In addition to fundamental front-end programming concepts, this section explores best practices in responsive design and accessibility. Ensuring that a website adapts to different screen sizes and is usable by people of all abilities is a core responsibility of front-end developers. Understanding how the DOM works, how CSS can create fluid layouts, and how JavaScript can enhance user experience helps developers build web applications that are not only functional but also inclusive. As front-end development continues to evolve with new frameworks and tools, mastering these core principles provides a strong foundation for future learning and adaptation.
