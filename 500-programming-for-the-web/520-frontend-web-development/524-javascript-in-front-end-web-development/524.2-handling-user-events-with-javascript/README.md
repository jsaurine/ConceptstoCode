# 524.2 / Handling user events with JavaScript

### TL;DR

JavaScript enhances interactivity in web applications by detecting and responding to user actions through event handling. Events occur when a user interacts with the webpage, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or entering data into a text field. In the context of HTML forms, JavaScript allows developers to validate user input, prevent form submission when data is incorrect, and dynamically update the user interface based on real-time interactions.

This section covers how events work, how to attach event listeners to form elements, and how to ensure robust form validation before data is sent to the server.

### Targets

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain what JavaScript events are and how they function within web applications
* Attach event listeners to form elements such as input fields, buttons, and forms
* Implement form validation using JavaScript to ensure correct user input
* Prevent default form submission behavior and handle form data dynamically

### What are events in JavaScript?

Events are interactions that occur between a user and a webpage. JavaScript provides event-handling mechanisms that allow developers to respond to these interactions dynamically.

In the context of HTML forms, common events include:

* **input**\
  Triggers when the user types into an input field
* **submit**\
  Occurs when a user attempts to submit a form
* **click**\
  Fires when a button is clicked

### HTML form tags and syntax

HTML forms allow users to input data and submit it to a server. Forms consist of various input elements wrapped inside a `<form>` tag. Each element serves a specific function for collecting user input.

The `<form>` tag follows a nested hierarchy with `<label>` and `<input>` tags being child elements of the parent `<form>` element.

<details>

<summary><strong>&#x3C;form></strong><br>Parent of &#x3C;label> and &#x3C;input></summary>

* **`action = "serverpage.php"`**\
  The send location for form data

- `method =`
  * `= "get"`\
    Appends form data to URL such as query parameters for searching or filtering data
  * `= "post"`\
    Sends data securely in HTTP request body for sensitive information such as passwords

</details>

<details>

<summary>&#x3C;label><br>Child of &#x3C;form> and sibling of &#x3C;input></summary>

* `for =`
  * `"inputID"`\
    Links to an `<input>` with the matching `id`
* `class = "label-class"`\
  Used for styling with CSS and an external stylesheet
* `style = "font-weight: 600;"`\
  Used for inline CSS styling

</details>

<details>

<summary>&#x3C;input><br>Child of &#x3C;form> and sibling of &#x3C;label></summary>

* `type =`
  * `= "text"` \
    Single-line text field
  * `= "email"`\
    Email validation
  * `= "checkbox"`\
    Multiple selection
  * `= "radio"`\
    Single selection
  * `= "submit"`\
    Submit button to send form data
  * `= reset`\
    Reset button to clear form contents
* `name = "field_name"`\
  Required so that the data field name is sent with the data, e.g., `first_name=Donald`
* `id = "inputID"`\
  Used for JavaScript event handling and/or CSS styling
* `placeholder = "User entry instructions go here"`\
  Used to provide user instructions to assist data entry
* `value = "12-Mar-2025"`\
  Provides a default value for the field (such as the current date)
* `required`\
  Ensures validated data is entered into the field for submission

</details>

### Handling form events using JavaScript event listeners

Event listeners attach functionality to elements so that JavaScript can respond when an event occurs. The `.addEventListener()` method allows developers to define custom behaviors when users interact with forms.

{% code title="Form submission event" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
document.getElementById("registrationForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the form from submitting
    console.log("Form submission prevented for validation.");
});
```
{% endcode %}

This code prevents the form from submitting immediately, allowing for validation before sending data to the server.

### Form validation using JavaScript

JavaScript can be used to validate user input before it is submitted, reducing errors and preventing unnecessary server requests.

#### Validating an Email Field

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
document.getElementById("email").addEventListener("input", function(event) {
    let emailField = event.target;
    if (!emailField.value.includes("@")) {
        emailField.style.borderColor = "red";
    } else {
        emailField.style.borderColor = "green";
    }
});
```
{% endcode %}

This code checks whether the email field contains an `@` symbol. If not, it highlights the field in red.

#### Ensuring required fields are filled

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
document.getElementById("registrationForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    let nameField = document.getElementById("name").value;
    if (nameField.trim() === "") {
        alert("Name field cannot be empty.");
        event.preventDefault();
    }
});
```
{% endcode %}

If the name field is empty, an alert is displayed, and the form submission is prevented.

### Preventing default form submission

By default, submitting an HTML form causes a page reload. JavaScript can prevent this behavior and instead process the data dynamically.

#### Handling form submission with JavaScript

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
document.getElementById("registrationForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Form submitted without refreshing the page.");
});
```
{% endcode %}

This is essential for modern web applications where data is often sent to a server using JavaScript instead of traditional form submission.

### Best practices for handling user events in forms

* Always use `event.preventDefault()` when handling form submissions to ensure validation is completed first
* Use event delegation to handle multiple input fields dynamically
* Avoid unnecessary event listeners on input fields to improve performance
* Provide real-time feedback to users, such as highlighting incorrect fields or displaying error messages

### Key Concepts

> * JavaScript events allow webpages to respond dynamically to user input.
> * Event listeners attach behavior to form elements, enabling validation and user feedback.
> * The submit event triggers when a form is submitted, and JavaScript can prevent default submission for validation.
> * Preventing default form behavior is essential for building modern, interactive web applications.

### Summary

Handling user events in JavaScript is crucial for making web forms interactive and user-friendly. By understanding event listeners, form validation, and event propagation, developers can build robust input-handling systems that provide immediate feedback and prevent incorrect data submissions.
