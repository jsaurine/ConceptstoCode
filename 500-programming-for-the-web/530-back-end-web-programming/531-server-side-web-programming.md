# 531 Server-side web programming

### Outline

This section introduces the core responsibilities of server-side programming, including how servers process requests, return dynamic content, and interface with databases and file systems. Students explore scripting languages such as Python and the use of frameworks to structure application logic. The section also covers shell scripting techniques used in deployment and file management, and introduces APIs as a tool for connecting systems.

Students will gain insight into the hidden operations that occur between the client and the server and learn how back-end development supports secure, responsive, and scalable applications.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the role of server-side code in handling user requests and application logic
* Use scripting languages and frameworks to generate dynamic responses
* Apply shell scripting to automate common file and text operations
* Investigate how web frameworks structure and simplify back-end development
* Describe the role of APIs in connecting front-end and back-end systems

### Overview

Server-side programming is where the core logic of a web application lives. It handles everything from processing form data and managing sessions to accessing databases and returning tailored responses. Unlike front-end code, which runs in the browser, server-side code runs on the server and controls how the system behaves under the hood.

In this section, students begin by exploring how requests are received and processed, then build functionality using scripting languages and frameworks. Shell scripting techniques provide students with hands-on experience in automating deployment and file management tasks. APIs are introduced as a method of exposing services securely and predictably to other systems and front-end clients.
