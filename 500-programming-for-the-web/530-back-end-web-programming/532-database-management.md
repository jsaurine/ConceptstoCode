# 532 Database management

### Outline

This section introduces how web applications use databases to store and access structured data. Students explore relational databases using SQL, learn how to write queries to filter and join data, and compare the SQL approach to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). They also examine how back-end systems use queries and data models to generate dynamic content and respond to user requests.

This section builds on studentsâ€™ understanding of back-end programming and prepares them to integrate database access into full-stack applications.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from a database
* Apply filtering, sorting, and joining techniques using SQL syntax
* Construct scripts that execute SQL from a web application
* Compare ORM with traditional SQL-based queries
* Connect web applications to relational or NoSQL databases

### Overview

Databases are essential for web applications that require persistent storage of user data, content, or system records. Whether logging in, placing an order, or browsing dynamic content, users rely on databases behind the scenes.

This section focuses on teaching students how to write SQL queries that support the back-end of a web application. Students learn to connect databases to a web framework, execute queries through code, and display results dynamically. They also explore the trade-offs between writing raw SQL and using an ORM, helping them choose the right tool for their application.
