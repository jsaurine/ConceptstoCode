# 531.3 APIs and JSON

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how back-end systems use **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** to communicate with front-end code and external services. Students learn how APIs expose structured data, how requests and responses work, and how **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is used as a lightweight, readable format for transmitting data. These concepts are foundational for building interactive and connected web applications.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Define an API and describe how it supports client-server communication
* Understand how HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) are used in API calls
* Read and write structured data using the JSON format
* Recognise how APIs are used to fetch, send, and update data in web applications
* Identify real-world examples of API integration

### What is an API?

An **API** is a structured way for software components to communicate. In web development, APIs are often used to:

* Send and receive data between client and server
* Allow external services (like maps, payment, or weather) to be integrated
* Support single-page apps or mobile apps by providing data endpoints

APIs follow the **request-response** model:

* The client sends a request to a URL (endpoint)
* The server processes it and sends a response, usually in JSON format

### Common HTTP methods in APIs

| Method | Purpose              |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| GET    | Retrieve data        |
| POST   | Create new data      |
| PUT    | Update existing data |
| DELETE | Remove data          |

### What is JSON?

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a text-based format for representing structured data.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

JSON is:

* Easy to read and write
* Language-independent
* Supported by most back-end frameworks and front-end JavaScript

### API example: returning JSON

Here’s a simple Flask example that returns JSON:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/api/user")
def get_user():
    return jsonify({"name": "Alice", "age": 25})
```

When a client visits `/api/user`, the server responds with structured JSON data.

### Using APIs on the front end

Front-end JavaScript uses `fetch()` to access APIs and update the page without reloading.

```javascript
fetch("/api/user")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

This pattern is common in single-page applications and data dashboards.

### Summary

APIs allow web applications to exchange data between the front end and the back end. JSON is the most common format for sending structured data. Understanding how APIs work and how to handle JSON is essential for building dynamic, data-driven applications.
