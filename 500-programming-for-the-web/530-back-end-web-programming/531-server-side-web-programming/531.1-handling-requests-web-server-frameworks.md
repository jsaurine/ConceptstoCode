# 531.1 Handling requests (web server frameworks)

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how back-end systems handle web requests from users. Students learn how web servers receive requests from the browser and pass them to back-end **frameworks**, which process the request, run logic, and generate responses. This introduces students to the concept of routing, middleware, and server-side control in a web application.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the role of a web server in a web application
* Describe how back-end frameworks process and respond to requests
* Understand how routing maps URLs to specific logic
* Identify the parts of a server-side response cycle
* Recognise how requests are handled differently on the back end compared to the front end

### What is a web server?

A **web server** is a program that listens for incoming HTTP requests from a browser (client) and returns the correct response.

Examples of web servers:

* **Apache**
* **Nginx**
* **Gunicorn** (Python)
* **Node.js** (JavaScript)

When a user visits a webpage:

1. The browser sends a request to the web server
2. The server forwards the request to the appropriate handler or framework
3. The server sends back the HTML, JSON, or other data as a response

### The role of a web framework

A **web framework** is a back-end development tool that simplifies handling requests, managing routes, and connecting to databases.

Popular frameworks include:

* **Flask** and **Django** (Python)
* **Express** (JavaScript/Node.js)
* **Laravel** (PHP)
* **Ruby on Rails** (Ruby)

Frameworks allow developers to define how the server should respond to different types of requests using **routes** and **controllers**.

#### Example (Python with Flask)

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Welcome to the homepage!"
```

This example responds with a welcome message when a user visits the root URL (`/`).

### How routing works

**Routing** is how a web framework maps a specific URL (e.g. `/login`) to a function that handles the request. Developers define routes for:

* Pages (`/home`, `/about`)
* Actions (`/submit`, `/logout`)
* API endpoints (`/api/users`, `/api/data`)

Routing logic determines which code is run and what response is sent.

### Summary

The back end of a web application is responsible for receiving requests, running server-side logic, and returning the appropriate response. Web servers and frameworks work together to route requests, connect to resources like databases, and generate dynamic content for users.
