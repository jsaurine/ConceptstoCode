# 512.3 SMTP, POP3, and IMAP

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how email is transferred between systems using dedicated communication protocols. **SMTP** is used to send messages, while **POP3** and **IMAP** are used to retrieve and manage inboxes. These protocols are fundamental to email applications and illustrate how the Internet supports asynchronous communication through structured standards.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the function of SMTP in sending email
* Describe how POP3 and IMAP retrieve messages from a server
* Compare POP3 and IMAP based on user experience and technical behaviour
* Understand how these protocols integrate with email clients and servers
* Recognise how protocol design supports accessibility across devices

### Email transmission protocols

#### SMTP – Sending email

**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** is used to send messages from an email client to a mail server, or from one mail server to another.

* Used when clicking “Send” in an email application
* Pushes the email to the recipient’s mail server
* Only supports outbound messages

#### POP3 – Download and delete

**Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)** retrieves emails by downloading them to a local device, then typically deleting them from the server.

* Simple and resource-efficient
* Works best on a single device
* Not suitable for users who check email from multiple devices

#### IMAP – Server-based access

**Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)** allows users to view and manage emails while keeping them stored on the server.

* Supports synchronisation across devices
* Reflects folder structure and message status across platforms
* Common in cloud-based email systems

### Summary

SMTP, POP3, and IMAP are the core protocols that allow emails to be sent and received over the internet. Each serves a different purpose: SMTP for sending, POP3 for downloading, and IMAP for synchronised inbox access. Understanding these protocols helps clarify how everyday communication is handled behind the scenes.
