# 511 Web programming

### TL:DR

Web programming is the process of developing websites and web applications that run on browsers, enabling interactive and dynamic user experiences. It involves structuring content with HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding interactivity using JavaScript. Web development is typically divided into front-end (user interface and experience) and back-end (server-side processing, databases, and logic), with some developers working across both as full-stack developers. Modern web programming also incorporates APIs, frameworks, and libraries that enhance efficiency, scalability, and performance. As the web evolves, new technologies, standards, and best practices continue to shape the way web applications are built and maintained.

### **What is web programming?**

Web programming involves creating websites and applications that shape our digital experiences. Whether we shop online, stream content, or engage on social media, web programming combines design and logic to enable seamless interactions over the Internet.

### **Why is web programming necessary?**

Web programming powers the platforms we rely on daily—Amazon for shopping, Google for research, and Instagram for social sharing. It enables businesses to reach customers, educators to deliver learning materials, and individuals to access entertainment and organizational tools. Beyond building websites, web programming solves real-world problems, such as secure payment processing and inventory management in e-commerce.

### **How web programming works**

Web programming functions through a client-server model. The client (browser) requests data, and the server responds, sending the necessary files for display. This rapid exchange follows protocols like HTTP, ensuring seamless communication between the two.

#### **Client-server network**

A client-server network is a system where clients access resources from a central server over a local (LAN) or wide-area network (WAN) like the Internet.

### **Key technologies in web programming**

#### **Frontend development (user interface & experience)**

Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with, using:

* HTML – Provides webpage structure.
* CSS – Styles the content with colours, fonts, and layouts.
* JavaScript – Enables interactivity, such as button clicks and real-time updates.

#### **Backend development (logic & data processing)**

Back-end development ensures functionality and data management through:

* Server-Side Languages – Python, PHP, or Node.js handle requests and logic.
* Databases – MySQL, MongoDB store user data, such as profiles and shopping carts.
* APIs & Architecture – Facilitate communication between front-end and back-end.

### **The evolution of web programming**

* 1990s – Static HTML pages dominated.
* 2000s – JavaScript and server-side scripting enabled dynamic websites.
* 2010s – Frameworks like React and Angular improved interactivity.
* Today – Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) offer native app-like experiences with offline functionality.

### Key Concepts

> * **Web programming** refers to the process of designing, structuring, and implementing websites and web applications that run in browsers.
> * **Front-end development** focuses on building the user interface (UI) and experience (UX) using HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity.
> * **Back-end development** handles server-side logic, databases, and application processing using languages such as Python, PHP, and Node.js.
> * **Full-stack development** involves working across both front-end and back-end technologies, requiring knowledge of UI design, databases, and server logic.
> * **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** allow web applications to communicate with external services, enabling data exchange and functionality expansion.
> * **Frameworks and libraries**, such as React, Vue.js, and Angular, provide tools to streamline front-end development, while Django, Flask, and Express.js support back-end development.
> * **Web programming best practices** include responsive design, accessibility, performance optimisation, and security considerations to ensure high-quality, scalable applications.
> * The field of web development is constantly evolving, with advancements in **progressive web apps (PWAs)**, cloud computing, and AI-driven web applications shaping the future of web experiences.
