# 511 Applications of web programming

### Overview

Modern web development supports a wide range of applications that extend far beyond static webpages. From interactive content and real-time collaboration to full-scale e-commerce and installable web apps, the web has evolved into a platform for delivering complex, engaging experiences.

This topic introduces three major categories of web application: interactive websites, e-commerce systems, and progressive web apps (PWAs). Students will explore the features, advantages, and use cases for each, preparing them to design and build web solutions suited to real-world needs.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Identify and describe key applications of modern web development
* Distinguish between interactive websites, e-commerce platforms, and PWAs
* Evaluate how web technologies support different types of user experiences
* Explain how PWAs blur the line between native apps and browser-based software

Explore the applications of web programming, including:\
– interactive website/webpages\
– e-commerce\
– progressive web apps (PWAs)

### Interactive websites

Interactive websites go beyond static text and images to engage users through input, feedback, and real-time updates. These may include:

* Forms and search features
* Embedded maps or calendars
* Chatbots or comment systems
* Data visualisations and animations

They rely on a combination of HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), and JavaScript (behaviour).

#### Example:

A job search website allows users to filter listings by location, salary, or job type, then submit applications directly through the site.

### E-commerce applications

E-commerce platforms enable users to browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, and complete secure payments—all through a web interface. These systems typically involve:

* Product catalogues
* Shopping carts
* Secure checkout processes
* Integration with payment gateways (e.g. Stripe, PayPal)

Backend databases manage inventory, pricing, orders, and customer accounts.

#### Example:

A clothing retailer’s website lets customers browse items, apply discount codes, and track orders through an account portal.

### Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

PWAs are web applications that behave like native apps. They can be installed on a user’s device, work offline, and use device features like notifications or location.

Key features of PWAs include:

* Responsive design
* Offline support via service workers
* Installability (with an app icon)
* Fast loading and smooth interactions

They are built using standard web technologies but enhanced with modern APIs.

#### Example:

A transit app that works in the browser but also installs to a smartphone and shows real-time bus locations—even without an internet connection.

**Image caption suggestion:** _Screenshot or mock-up comparing a native mobile app and a PWA version with nearly identical UI._

### Summary

* Web programming supports a variety of application types, each suited to different user needs
* Interactive websites enhance engagement through forms, media, and real-time content
* E-commerce systems support secure transactions and manage inventory and accounts
* PWAs combine the reach of the web with the functionality of installed applications
