# 517.1 Encryption and certificates

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how encryption is used to protect data sent over the internet. Students learn the difference between **plain text** and **ciphertext**, how **encryption algorithms and keys** work, and why websites use **digital certificates** to enable secure communication using HTTPS. These ideas form the foundation of web security and will be reinforced in later topics.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the difference between plain text and cipher text
* Describe how encryption protects sensitive information
* Understand how encryption keys and algorithms work together
* Recognise the role of SSL/TLS in securing websites
* Explain how digital certificates are used to establish trust

**Explain the processes for securing the web**

* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates
* encryption algorithms
* encryption keys
* plain text and ciphertext

### What is encryption?

**Encryption** is the process of transforming readable data (**plain text**) into an unreadable format (**ciphertext**) to prevent unauthorised access. Only someone with the correct **key** can decrypt the message.

Encryption is used in web applications to:

* Protect login credentials
* Secure personal or financial data
* Prevent tampering or eavesdropping during transmission

#### Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption

* **Symmetric encryption** uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data
* **Asymmetric encryption** uses a **public key** to encrypt and a **private key** to decrypt

Web applications use both methods at different stages of the HTTPS handshake.

### SSL/TLS and secure websites

Websites that use **HTTPS** encrypt all traffic using a protocol called **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, which replaced the older **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**.

This prevents:

* data from being read during transmission.
* attackers from impersonating a website.
* passwords and personal data from being stolen in transit.

### What is a digital certificate?

A **digital certificate** proves that a website is authentic. It includes:

* The domain name
* The public key
* The name of the certificate authority (CA)
* An expiry date

When you visit a secure website:

1. The server provides its certificate
2. The browser verifies the certificate using the CA
3. A secure connection is established

### Summary

Encryption is essential for protecting data as it travels over the internet. It works by converting plain text into ciphertext using keys and algorithms. Websites that use HTTPS rely on digital certificates and TLS encryption to ensure secure, trusted communication between users and servers.
