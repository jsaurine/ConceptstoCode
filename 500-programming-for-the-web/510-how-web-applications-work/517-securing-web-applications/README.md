# 517 Securing web applications

### Outline

This section explores the core security mechanisms used to protect web applications. Students investigate how encryption, certificates, and secure protocols protect data in transit and at rest. They examine the roles of authentication, authorisation, and hashing in managing access and integrity, and learn how these technologies work together to create trusted digital systems.

These concepts connect closely with the security principles explored in earlier modules and prepare students for practical implementation in both front-end and back-end contexts.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain how SSL certificates and encryption protect web communication
* Distinguish between plain text and cipher text
* Understand the use of encryption keys and algorithms
* Apply authentication and authorisation principles to control access
* Describe how hashing and digital signatures ensure data integrity

### Glossary

| Term                  | Definition                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encryption**        | The process of converting plain text into unreadable cipher text to protect data |
| **SSL/TLS**           | Security protocols that encrypt web traffic and verify server identity           |
| **Authentication**    | Verifying the identity of a user or system                                       |
| **Authorisation**     | Determining what actions a user or system is allowed to perform                  |
| **Hash function**     | A one-way function that transforms data into a fixed-length value                |
| **Digital signature** | A cryptographic tool that confirms data integrity and authenticity               |
| **Encryption key**    | A value used by an algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data                          |
| **Plain text**        | Readable data before it is encrypted                                             |
| **Cipher text**       | Data that has been encrypted and is unreadable without the correct key           |

### Overview

Security is a fundamental requirement of every web application. Users must be able to trust that their data is protected and that their interactions are private, verified, and safe. In this section, students explore the practical tools used to secure web applicationsâ€”from cryptographic algorithms and secure connections to identity verification and access control.

Understanding these technologies is essential for developing full-stack applications that not only function well, but also protect users, data, and services from evolving threats.
