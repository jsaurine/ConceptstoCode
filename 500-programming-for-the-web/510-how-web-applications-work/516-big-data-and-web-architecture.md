# 516 Big data and web architecture

### Overview

In this topic, we explore how the rise of big data is transforming web architecture. From streaming platforms to recommendation engines, modern web applications increasingly depend on processing large volumes of data. Students examine how this trend affects the structure and design of web systems, with a focus on metadata, data mining, and the challenges of managing continuous data streams.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Define big data and identify its sources in web applications
* Describe the role of metadata in filtering, sorting, and categorising online content
* Explain how data mining is used in personalisation and analytics
* Understand how streaming services deliver large volumes of data in real time
* Recognise how big data influences scalability and system design

### What is big data?

**Big data** refers to datasets that are too large or complex to be processed using traditional methods. Web platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, or Amazon handle enormous volumes of data that must be stored, retrieved, and analysed efficiently. These systems are designed to scale horizontally and support rapid access to large datasets in real time.

### The role of metadata

**Metadata** is data about data. In web applications, it is used to:

* Describe content (e.g. title, genre, creator, tags)
* Improve search and filtering
* Power recommendation engines

For example, video platforms use metadata to sort videos by category, popularity, or publication date.

It helps the classification, access and storage of digital assets of all kinds. It is with metadata that the encoding of knowledge within any data element is possible.</p></figcaption></figure>

Metadata helps web applications categorise and retrieve content efficiently, supporting personalised search and user experiences.

### Data mining in web systems

**Data mining** is the process of finding patterns in large datasets. In web applications, it is used to:

* Recommend products, songs, or videos based on user behaviour
* Identify trends and predict demand
* Detect anomalies or potential security issues

Websites often analyse usage patterns to improve performance or tailor content to individual users.

### Streaming service management

Streaming platforms must deliver data continuously with low delay. This affects web architecture by requiring:

* **Data buffering** to handle network interruptions
* **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** to reduce load times
* **Load balancing** to distribute requests evenly across servers

Real-time data transmission presents challenges for latency, bandwidth, and storage.

### Summary

Big data influences how web systems are designed and scaled. Metadata makes content searchable and customisable, data mining helps systems learn from behaviour, and streaming services require fast, distributed infrastructure. Understanding these forces is critical for building scalable, data-driven web applications.
