# 526 Web standards and ethical development

### Overview

In this topic, we explore the importance of web standards and ethical development practices in building accessible, secure, and trustworthy web applications. Students learn how standards from organisations like the **W3C** promote consistency, how ethical considerations guide design choices, and how inclusivity and privacy must be central to all web-based projects.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the purpose of web standards and how they are developed
* Identify how standards ensure compatibility and accessibility
* Apply ethical principles in the design and deployment of web applications
* Recognise the importance of privacy, security, and user consent
* Consider inclusivity and cultural context in interface and content design

### The role of web standards

Web standards define how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should behave across browsers and platforms. They:

* Promote consistency
* Prevent vendor-specific code and lock-in
* Ensure content is usable across devices
* Support assistive technologies

Standards are developed and maintained by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** and adopted by all major browser vendors.

#### W3C and the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

The **WAI** provides guidelines for accessible web design, including:

* Alternative text for images
* Semantic structure for screen readers
* Keyboard navigation support
* Colour contrast recommendations

Adhering to these standards helps make the web more inclusive.

### Internationalisation and localisation

Web applications must be usable by people in different:

* Languages
* Regions
* Cultures

Best practices include:

* Supporting UTF-8 for multilingual text
* Formatting dates, times, and currency appropriately
* Avoiding culturally specific language or assumptions

### Privacy and ethical considerations

Web developers have a responsibility to protect users’ data and respect their rights. Ethical web development includes:

* Using HTTPS to secure communication
* Limiting data collection to what is necessary
* Providing clear consent for cookies or tracking
* Avoiding dark patterns or deceptive design

Privacy legislation such as the **GDPR** (Europe) or **Australian Privacy Act** places legal requirements on how data is stored, shared, and deleted.

### Summary

Ethical, standards-based development ensures that web applications are usable, inclusive, and respectful of users’ rights. By following W3C standards, considering accessibility and cultural diversity, and protecting privacy and security, developers build systems that are reliable, respectful, and future-proof.
