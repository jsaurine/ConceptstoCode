# 520 Frontend web development

### Outline

This chapter introduces the essential tools and practices used in front-end web development. Students will learn how HTML structures content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes it interactive. The chapter also explores responsive design, accessibility, and common front-end libraries that accelerate development and improve user experience.

* Structure content using HTML tags and attributes
* Apply styles using CSS and understand its cascading rules
* Enhance interactivity using JavaScript and DOM manipulation
* Implement responsive layouts and design principles

### Overview

Front-end web programming brings websites to life by managing everything a user sees and interacts with. HTML provides the structural backbone, CSS controls presentation and layout, and JavaScript adds dynamic behaviour. Together, these technologies form the foundation of every interactive web page.

This chapter begins with foundational markup using HTML, then explores styling techniques with CSS, including cascading rules and media queries. Students then move into JavaScript, learning how to manipulate the DOM, respond to user events, and fetch data from APIs. The chapter concludes with a study of responsive design, accessibility principles, and the growing role of front-end libraries and frameworks in modern web development.
