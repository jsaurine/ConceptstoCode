# 150 Project management foundations

This section introduces the basics of project management, focusing on setting project goals, defining scope, and planning for software development. You will learn to create clear objectives, allocate resources, and manage project risks. Additionally, you will explore iterative development and understand the importance of feedback loops, version control, and collaboration in software projects. You can effectively manage the complete software development process by mastering these skills.

### Introduction

Imagine you’re part of a software development team tasked with creating a new app to help small businesses manage their finances and operations more efficiently. You’ll need more than coding skills to deliver a successful project—careful planning, clear goals, and structured collaboration are essential. Project management provides the structure that guides a team from the initial idea to the final product, ensuring everyone is on the same page and that potential challenges are identified and managed.

We will explore essential project management concepts: setting project goals and objectives, planning and scheduling, using iterative development and feedback loops, and managing risks. With these skills, you’ll learn how to keep a project organised, efficient, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

### 1.5.1 Project Goals and Objectives

#### Defining clear goals

The foundation of any successful project is a set of clear, specific goals. Imagine that your team is tasked with developing an app with financial tools for small businesses. What does “successful completion” look like? SMART goals provide a practical framework, as they are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For example:

* **Specific**\
  Develop an app with expense tracking, tax calculation, and invoicing features
* **Measurable**\
  Complete development of all core features within a specified budget
* **Achievable**\
  Ensure the app meets basic financial management requirements for small businesses
* **Relevant**\
  Align the app’s functionality with small business needs, perhaps integrating tax compliance features
* **Time-bound**\
  Complete the project within six months

By defining goals this way, the team has a clear target, making measuring progress easier and ensuring the project stays focused.

#### Understanding project scope

Once goals are set, defining the project scope is essential for establishing what is included and what isn’t. Scope defines the project's boundaries, helping prevent “scope creep,” where additional features or tasks are added without proper planning. For example, the small business app's scope might include core financial tools but exclude more complex features like payroll integration.

By outlining these boundaries, the team can ensure all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the deliverables, timeline, and constraints, keeping the project on budget and meeting deadlines.

#### Role of stakeholders

In any project, stakeholders—the people or groups invested in the outcome—play a key role. These could include small business owners, the development team, and potential end-users. Understanding their needs helps align project goals with user and business requirements.

For instance, consulting with small business owners might reveal a need for simple tax management, while compliance experts might recommend features to ensure accurate tax reporting. Engaging stakeholders early and regularly provides the project’s direction aligns with the needs of those who will benefit most from the final product.

### 1.5.2 Project Planning and Scheduling

#### Creating a project timeline

With goals, scope, and stakeholder expectations defined, the next step is to plan the project timeline. Dividing the project into phases—research, design, development, testing, and deployment—creates a roadmap for the team. A Gantt chart is a standard tool for visualising these phases, showing tasks, dependencies, and deadlines.

For example, in the small business app project, the timeline might allocate two weeks to design, three months to development, and six weeks to testing. Organising the project phases on a timeline allows the team to understand better when to expect key deliverables and identify potential bottlenecks.

#### Resource allocation

Resource allocation ensures the team has the necessary resources—people, tools, budget—to complete each project phase effectively. For instance, the app project may require specific roles such as developers, designers, and business analysts and access to design software and testing tools.

Resource planning also involves budgeting, ensuring each phase stays within its financial limits. Allocating resources strategically helps the project run smoothly and prevents delays due to resource shortages.

#### Milestones and deliverables

Breaking down the project into milestones and deliverables provides structure and helps track progress. A milestone is a significant checkpoint in the project, such as completing the initial design or prototype. Each milestone includes specific deliverables, which are tangible outputs, like design mockups or a working app feature.

For instance, a milestone might be completing the expense tracking feature by a specific date. Meeting these checkpoints helps keep the project on track, ensuring the team achieves steady progress and addresses any issues early.

### 1.5.3 Iterative Development and Feedback Loops

#### Agile and iterative approaches

The software development landscape constantly evolves, and user needs can change rapidly. Agile development offers an iterative approach to managing these changes. Rather than following a strict, linear path, Agile breaks the project into small, manageable increments called “sprints,” each focused on specific features or functions.

For the small business app, this might mean developing the invoicing feature in the first sprint, the tax calculation feature in the next, and so on. After each sprint, the team assesses progress and makes adjustments based on feedback, enabling continuous improvement and flexibility.

#### Importance of feedback loops

Feedback loops are critical in Agile development, allowing the team to gather input from stakeholders at the end of each sprint. For instance, after completing the expense tracking feature, the team might share a prototype with small business owners for feedback. This feedback helps the team improve and adapt the product to meet user needs, fostering a collaborative development process.

#### Version control

As the team collaborates on code, version control tools like Git help manage changes, track revisions, and resolve conflicts. Imagine one developer working on the invoicing feature while another refines the expense tracking module. Using Git allows them to work simultaneously, saving versions of their code and making collaborating easier without overwriting each other’s work.

Version control is essential for tracking the evolution of the codebase, ensuring the team can revert to previous versions if necessary, and maintaining an organised, structured project.

### 1.5.4 Risk Management and documentation

#### Identifying and assessing risks

Projects have risks, including technical challenges, timeline delays, and budget constraints. For example, the app project might have risks such as a delay in integrating with external tax systems or unexpected technical issues with data management. Identifying these risks early and assessing their likelihood and impact helps the team prepare for potential obstacles.

For instance, if the team identifies integration delays as a potential risk, they can allocate additional time in the project schedule to accommodate delays.

#### Implementing mitigation strategies

Once risks are identified, the team develops mitigation strategies to manage them. For example, if integration delays are a risk, the team might create a backup plan to provide basic tax calculations without integration initially, adding the feature later. Other strategies include quality checks to prevent software bugs or adjusting project scope if the timeline becomes too tight.

By proactively planning for risks, the team can prevent delays and manage unexpected challenges more effectively.

#### Documenting project progress

Clear and detailed documentation is essential in project management. It provides a record of the project’s scope, requirements, timeline, and decision-making processes. Documentation helps keep stakeholders informed and provides a reference for future decisions.

For instance, documenting integration requirements for compliance ensures everyone understands what needs to be done. By maintaining up-to-date documentation, the team promotes transparency and accountability, making managing the project easier and sustaining alignment among all parties.
