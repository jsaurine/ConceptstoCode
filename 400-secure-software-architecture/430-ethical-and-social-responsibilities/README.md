### Introduction

Writing secure software means more than getting the code right. It also involves making responsible decisions about data, intellectual property, collaboration, and the role technology plays in society.

This section explores the broader context in which software is developed. You'll examine how laws shape development practices, how ethical dilemmas arise, and how collaboration and professionalism impact quality and trust.

These issues are not peripheral to security â€” they are central. Secure systems must be designed not just to protect data, but to serve people fairly, legally, and ethically.
