# 430.1 Legal responsibilities

### TL;DR

Software engineers must navigate a range of legal responsibilities when developing secure and ethical systems. This includes protecting intellectual property, handling personal data lawfully, and ensuring compliance with licensing agreements and privacy regulations. This topic investigates how copyright, data protection laws, and digital contracts influence software engineering decisions.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Identify and explain key legal concepts relevant to software engineering, including copyright, intellectual property, and data privacy
* Describe the developer’s responsibility in complying with data protection laws and licensing requirements
* Recognise the consequences of breaching legal obligations in software development
* Evaluate real-world examples of legal disputes and their outcomes
* Apply legal principles to case studies involving software creation, distribution, and data usage

### Copyright and intellectual property

When developers write code, create digital assets, or design a unique algorithm, they are producing something that may be protected by copyright or other forms of intellectual property (IP) law.

* Copyright protects original creative works, including source code, images, text, and documentation.
* Patents may apply to novel inventions like a new algorithm or device.
* Trademarks protect brand names, logos, or slogans associated with software.

Developers must also respect others' IP rights. Copying or modifying code from another source without permission, even if it’s publicly available, may breach copyright.

#### Example

Using GPL-licensed code in a closed-source commercial app without meeting the license conditions could expose a developer or company to legal action.

### Open source and licensing

Many developers use open-source libraries and frameworks, each with unique license terms. Standard open-source licences include:

* MIT Licence – Permissive and widely used; allows reuse with attribution
* GNU General Public Licence (GPL) – Requires derivative works also to be open source (copyleft)
* Apache Licence – Similar to MIT but includes a grant of patent rights

#### Key responsibilities

* Read and comply with the licence terms
* Attribute authors where required
* Avoid mixing incompatible licences in one project

#### Example

A developer who embeds GPL code into their product may be required to publicly release their entire source code.

### Data privacy and legal compliance

Software must comply with data protection laws when it collects, stores, or processes user data. In Australia, this includes the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). International equivalents include:

* GDPR (EU) – General Data Protection Regulation
* CCPA (California) – California Consumer Privacy Act

Key developer obligations include:

* Collecting only necessary data
* Stating how data will be used
* Securing personal information
* Allowing users to access or delete their data

Failure to comply with these regulations can result in severe penalties, reputational harm, and legal proceedings.

#### Example

In 2021, the Australian government fined a health service provider for failing to secure personal data, breaching its obligations under the Privacy Act.

### Digital contracts and terms of use

Users who install or register for software often agree to the terms of service or end-user license agreements (EULAS). These digital contracts set out what users can and cannot do, and what the software provider is responsible for.

As a developer, you may contribute to these contracts by:

* Ensuring the terms reflect actual software behaviour
* Avoiding deceptive or unfair practices
* Respecting consumer protections (under the Australian Consumer Law or international equivalents)

### Case study: Privacy breach and legal fallout

#### Scenario

A fitness app collects and shares users' health data with third parties without informed consent. Users discover this via a media report.

Legal risks include:

* Breach of the Australian Privacy Principles (data minimisation, consent, transparency)
* Failure to disclose data sharing in terms of the service
* Potential class action from affected users

#### Developer takeaway

Failure to meet legal and ethical obligations can result in major financial and reputational damage, even if the technical solution functions well.
