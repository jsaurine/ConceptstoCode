# 420.1 The secure software development lifecycle









### **Threat Prevention and Risk Management**

#### **Threat Modeling**: Identifying and Assessing Risks

Imagine planning a road trip and anticipating potential hazards, like weather or traffic, so that you can prepare accordingly. **Threat modelling** involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that could harm a system. By understanding the highest risks, developers can design software to guard against them.

In practice, threat modelling might involve analysing how an attacker might breach a system and where defences are weak. It’s a proactive approach that shapes development, ensuring that security measures directly address the most significant threats.

#### **Regular Security Audits and Testing**: Staying Resilient

Just like you’d get a car checked regularly to keep it safe, software requires periodic **security audits and testing** to identify and fix new vulnerabilities. Software can become exposed to new threats with each new update or added feature. Regular penetration testing, where security experts simulate attacks, helps ensure the system can withstand emerging risks.

For example, e-commerce sites frequently undergo security testing before major sales events to ensure they can handle traffic and protect against cyber threats. This ongoing vigilance keeps software resilient against evolving attacks.

#### **Patch Management**: Updating to Protect Against Known Vulnerabilities

Imagine hearing about a weakness in your car’s locking system and not getting it fixed—it would leave your vehicle vulnerable. **Patch management** updates software by applying patches or fixes when vulnerabilities are discovered. This is particularly important for widely used libraries and third-party components, as attackers often target known vulnerabilities.

For instance, popular libraries like OpenSSL (used for encryption) regularly release security patches. Developers must apply these patches promptly to ensure their software isn’t at risk. Patch management is essential in maintaining secure systems over time.
