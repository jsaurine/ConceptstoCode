* Identify and apply software development techniques and security strategies used to:
  * reduce vulnerabilities
  * mitigate risk
  * prevent attacks
* Describe how the capabilities and experience of end users influence the secure design features of software

- Explain the social, ethical and legal implications of software engineering, including:
  * access and equity
  * digital inclusion

### What is risk modelling?

**Risk modelling** is a process used to anticipate how a system might fail â€” whether from human error, technical limitations, or malicious attacks. Developers use models to map out potential threats and prioritise ways to defend against them.

Risk modelling helps answer questions like:

* What are the most valuable assets in this system?
* Who might want to access, misuse, or damage them?
* Where are the weak points in the architecture or user flow?

By thinking through risks **before building**, developers can reduce the chance of late-stage vulnerabilities.

### Common risk modelling tools

<table><thead><tr><th width="194.5">Tool</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>STRIDE</strong></td><td>Framework to identify threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attack trees</strong></td><td>Diagrams showing how a goal (e.g. stealing data) might be achieved through different actions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use/misuse cases</strong></td><td>User stories written from both legitimate and malicious perspectives</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Threat matrices</strong></td><td>Charts mapping probability and impact of threats to prioritise response</td></tr></tbody></table>

These models are most effective when shared across teams during the design and planning phases.

### Designing for real users

Even well-secured systems can fail if users can't understand or use them correctly. **User-centred design** helps ensure that security mechanisms work for the people they protect.

#### Real-world design considerations:

* **Accessibility**: Are features usable by people with disabilities, older users, or those with limited literacy or digital access?
* **Cultural and situational context**: Does the system make unsafe assumptions (e.g. always having access to SMS)?
* **Cognitive load**: Are security tasks (like 2FA or passwords) simple, transparent, and supported?

Secure design must consider **not only what users should do, but also what they can actually do.**

### Examples of inclusive secure design

* Allowing multiple authentication options (e.g. app-based or email-based 2FA)
* Designing error messages that help users fix mistakes without exposing sensitive information
* Minimising unnecessary data collection to avoid creating privacy risk
* Using icons and colour contrast that meet accessibility standards

### Summary

* Risk modelling helps teams anticipate threats before they become vulnerabilities.
* STRIDE, misuse cases, and threat matrices are tools to structure this thinking.
* Secure design must match the capabilities, behaviours and constraints of real users.
