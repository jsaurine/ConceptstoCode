# 420.5 Secure APIs and defensive coding

### **Secure Coding Practices**

#### **Input Validation**: Ensuring Safe Data Entry

Imagine opening a website and typing in your username, only to discover that it can’t handle certain characters and crashes. **Input validation** checks and sanitises user inputs to ensure they’re both correct and safe to process. Without it, an attacker could input malicious code, exploiting vulnerabilities through attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

Consider input validation as a security guard checking a package's contents before entering a secure building. By allowing only safe and valid inputs, developers prevent dangerous data from entering the system, protecting it from potential breaches.

#### **Error Handling and Logging**: Tracking Without Exposing

Imagine you try logging into an app, but it gives you an error message that reveals technical details about the system. **Error handling and logging** ensure that error messages don’t expose sensitive information while still recording important security events.

In a secure system, error messages should be vague to outsiders but detailed in logs for authorised personnel. This helps track and diagnose issues without revealing sensitive system details. For example, an online banking app might display a simple “Login error” message instead of the details about why it failed, thus not exposing critical system details that attackers could use.

#### **Use of Secure Libraries and Frameworks**: Leveraging Trusted Resources

Imagine building a bridge using materials not tested for strength or durability. Unreliable libraries or frameworks can create vulnerabilities in software. Secure development involves selecting well-maintained, tested, and security-focused libraries and frameworks to ensure stability and minimize potential risks.

For instance, developers choose popular frameworks like React or Angular for web applications because they’re regularly updated and security-tested by a large community. Using secure libraries and frameworks helps engineers avoid common vulnerabilities and build on a stable foundation.
