* Describe how the capabilities and experience of end users influence the secure design features of software
* Use and explain the ‘privacy by design’ approach in the development of software solutions, including:\
  – proactive, not reactive approach\
  – embed privacy into design\
  – respect for user privacy
* Use and explain the contribution of cryptography and sandboxing to the ‘security by design’ approach in the development of software solutions

### What is risk modelling?

**Risk modelling** is a process used to anticipate how a system might fail — whether from human error, technical limitations, or malicious attacks. Developers use models to map out potential threats and prioritise ways to defend against them.

Risk modelling helps answer questions like:

* What are the most valuable assets in this system?
* Who might want to access, misuse, or damage them?
* Where are the weak points in the architecture or user flow?

By thinking through risks **before building**, developers can reduce the chance of late-stage vulnerabilities.

### Common risk modelling tools

<table><thead><tr><th width="194.5">Tool</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>STRIDE</strong></td><td>Framework to identify threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attack trees</strong></td><td>Diagrams showing how a goal (e.g. stealing data) might be achieved through different actions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Use/misuse cases</strong></td><td>User stories written from both legitimate and malicious perspectives</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Threat matrices</strong></td><td>Charts mapping probability and impact of threats to prioritise response</td></tr></tbody></table>

These models are most effective when shared across teams during the design and planning phases.

The STRIDE framework is modelled in depth in the expandable section below.

STRIDE threat modelling is a specific kind of threat modelling methodology (or method). It is a mnemonic of six types of security threats. Each letter of STRIDE stands for one of the six types of security threats:

* **S**poofing
* **T**ampering
* **R**epudiation
* **I**nformation Disclosure
* **D**enial of Service
* **E**levation of Privilege

STRIDE threat modelling is helpful because it can tell us ‘what can go wrong’ on the application, system, IT landscape, or business process that we’re (threat) modelling.

### Why STRIDE threat modelling is needed <a href="#id-2-why-do-you-need-stride-threat-modeling" id="id-2-why-do-you-need-stride-threat-modeling"></a>

STRIDE is a simple threat modelling methodology that can be used by a wide variety of people, including those without a traditional background in information security.

Its simplicity means that a diverse group of team members can all work on STRIDE.

Having many team members with different backgrounds (including non-security and non-technical backgrounds) improves the overall quality and outcomes of threat modelling.

This makes it a significant threat modelling methodology. If you’d like to know why you should threat model at all, read [What is threat modelling?](https://threat-modeling.com/what-is-threat-modeling/)

### The types of STRIDE threats explained. <a href="#id-3-the-types-of-stride-threats-explained" id="id-3-the-types-of-stride-threats-explained"></a>

STRIDE is based on six common types of threats that we encounter today in applications, systems, IT landscapes, and even business processes. Below is an infographic outlining the six types of threats.

### Designing for real users

Even well-secured systems can fail if users can't understand or use them correctly. **User-centred design** helps ensure that security mechanisms work for the people they protect.

#### Real-world design considerations:

* **Accessibility**: Are features usable by people with disabilities, older users, or those with limited literacy or digital access?
* **Cultural and situational context**: Does the system make unsafe assumptions (e.g. always having access to SMS)?
* **Cognitive load**: Are security tasks (like 2FA or passwords) simple, transparent, and supported?

Secure design must consider **not only what users should do, but also what they can actually do.**

### Examples of inclusive secure design

* Allowing multiple authentication options (e.g. app-based or email-based 2FA)
* Designing error messages that help users fix mistakes without exposing sensitive information
* Minimising unnecessary data collection to avoid creating privacy risk
* Using icons and colour contrast that meet accessibility standards

### Summary

* Risk modelling helps teams anticipate threats before they become vulnerabilities.
* STRIDE, misuse cases, and threat matrices are tools to structure this thinking.
* Secure design must match the capabilities, behaviours and constraints of real users.
