# 420.3 Sandboxing and abstraction

> Learn how sandboxing and abstraction are used in real-world systems like iPadOS to enforce security, limit exposure, and protect user data.

### Objectives

* Define sandboxing and abstraction in the context of secure system architecture
* Understand how iPadOS uses these concepts to isolate risk and protect users

* Use and explain the contribution of cryptography and sandboxing to the ‘security by design’ approach in the development of software solutions

- Explore fundamental software design security concepts when developing programming code, including:\
  – confidentiality\
  – integrity\
  – availability\
  – authentication\
  – authorisation\
  – accountability

### What is sandboxing?

**Sandboxing** is the practice of running code in a restricted environment that limits what it can access or do. A sandbox isolates the code so that even if it is buggy or malicious, it can’t affect the rest of the system.

#### In iPadOS:

Apple’s iPadOS uses **per-app sandboxing** to restrict what each app can access:

* Each app runs in its own isolated container
* Apps cannot read or write data from other apps
* Apps must request permission to access sensitive features like the camera, microphone, or location
* Files saved by one app are invisible to others unless shared intentionally

This model protects the user from apps that try to overstep their boundaries and reduces the damage caused by bugs or malware.

### What is abstraction?

**Abstraction** hides internal complexity, exposing only what is necessary. It simplifies the interaction between developers and users, and reduces the risk of misuse.

#### In iPadOS:

Abstraction is used throughout the system:

* Apps interact with hardware (e.g. camera, Bluetooth) only through secure, high-level APIs
* The file system is abstracted so users don’t see system-level files or app internals
* Developers can only access frameworks that Apple exposes — internal system operations are hidden

This protects system integrity and encourages secure app development.

### Sandboxing and abstraction in secure system design

In iPadOS, sandboxing and abstraction are integral to Apple’s security-by-design philosophy. They protect the system even when apps misbehave or are compromised.

<table><thead><tr><th width="166.76953125">Concept</th><th>iPadOS implementation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sandboxing</strong></td><td>Each app runs in its own container with no access to system or other app data by default</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Abstraction</strong></td><td>Apps access system resources only through controlled APIs; complex internals are hidden</td></tr></tbody></table>

These design choices uphold the principles of **least privilege**, **separation of concerns**, and **defence in depth** — all core to secure software architecture.

### iPadOS vs desktop OS: Sandboxing and abstraction

<table><thead><tr><th width="174.15625">Feature</th><th>iPadOS (mobile model)</th><th>Traditional desktop OS (e.g. Windows/macOS)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sandboxing by default</strong></td><td>Every app is sandboxed automatically</td><td>Most apps have full access unless sandboxed explicitly</td></tr><tr><td><strong>File system access</strong></td><td>App has access only to its own files (containerised)</td><td>Apps can access most file paths unless restricted by permissions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Inter-app communication</strong></td><td>Strictly controlled (e.g. via share sheets or specific APIs)</td><td>Freer communication between apps and shared system resources</td></tr><tr><td><strong>System APIs</strong></td><td>Only exposed through predefined, secure frameworks</td><td>Developers often have access to low-level system functions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Permissions model</strong></td><td>App must request explicit user consent (e.g. location, camera)</td><td>Many features do not require user consent unless gated by system</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Default execution model</strong></td><td>Apps cannot run in the background indefinitely or start other processes</td><td>Apps can run background services, daemons, or interact with hardware freely</td></tr><tr><td><strong>User exposure to system internals</strong></td><td>Highly abstracted – users don’t see system folders or app binaries</td><td>Users can browse system files, install scripts, or modify settings</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Update and patching model</strong></td><td>Controlled, secure, system-level updates from Apple</td><td>Varies by OS; patching may be optional or fragmented</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Summary

* Sandboxing restricts what code or apps can access, protecting users and the system
* Abstraction hides complexity, reducing the chance of accidental or malicious misuse
* iPadOS is a clear example of both principles applied at the operating system level to enforce secure behaviour by default
