# 420 Designing for security

### Objectives

* Understand the importance of designing software with security built in from the start.
* Explore the secure development lifecycle and associated strategies.
* Recognise how software design choices affect security and user protection.

### Introduction

Security starts with design. Before any code is written, software engineers must think about how the system will behave — and how it might fail. Secure design considers both user needs and potential threats.

This section examines key strategies and models employed in designing software systems that are safe, resilient, and adaptable. You'll examine the stages of secure development, the role of risk modelling, and how to build protections into architecture and interfaces from the very beginning.
