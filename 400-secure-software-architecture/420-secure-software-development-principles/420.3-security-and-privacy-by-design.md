# 420.3 Security and privacy by design

### TL;DR

Security and privacy must be built into software systems from the start—not added as afterthoughts. This topic explores two key design philosophies: security by design, which integrates technical safeguards into architecture and development workflows; and privacy by design, which ensures user data is respected, minimised, and protected throughout the software lifecycle.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Describe the principles of security by design and privacy by design
* Explain the benefits of incorporating security and privacy early in the development process
* Apply strategies that reduce risk and uphold data protection laws
* Compare and contrast the aims and implementation of both design approaches
* Identify examples of features that support privacy-respecting and secure software
* Evaluate how these approaches improve resilience, compliance, and trustworthiness

### **Security by design**

Imagine constructing a house without locks on the doors, only to add them after moving in. It wouldn’t feel very safe. **Security by design** is about embedding security into each stage of software development rather than adding it as an afterthought. This proactive approach ensures that security considerations are integral from the beginning, making the software stronger and less vulnerable to attacks.

For example, when designing an app, developers plan for secure user authentication, data protection, and safe handling of user inputs right from the beginning. By integrating security checks into each SSDLC phase—planning, coding, testing, and deployment—engineers create a robust framework that minimises vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

Security by design is a proactive philosophy. Instead of trying to fix vulnerabilities after deployment, developers anticipate threats and integrate defences from the very beginning. This means designing software to be secure by default and resilient to misuse or attack.

#### **Key principles**

* **Threat modelling** is used early in planning to identify potential risks
* **Access control** is tightly managed (least privilege, separation of roles)
* **Input validation** is enforced at every interface
* **Secure defaults** are chosen (e.g. strongest encryption, minimal permissions)
* **Sensitive data is encrypted** in storage and transit
* **Audit trails** are created to support accountability

#### Example

A messaging app using security by design would encrypt all messages by default, prevent users from turning off encryption, and ensure access tokens expire automatically. It would also limit metadata collection and regularly audit access logs.

### **Privacy by design**

Privacy by design ensures that a system’s architecture and behaviour respect user data rights from the outset. It’s not just about protecting information from leaks; it’s about designing systems that minimise unnecessary collection, offer transparency, and give users control over their information.

This concept has been widely adopted in global privacy law frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and is part of Australian privacy reform discussions.

#### **Core principles**

* **Proactive, not reactive**: Prevent privacy risks before they occur
* **Privacy as the default setting**: No user action should be required to protect data
* **Privacy embedded into design**: It is a core system function, not an add-on
* **Full functionality—positive-sum, not zero-sum**: Achieve both privacy and usability
* **End-to-end security**: Data is protected throughout its lifecycle
* **Visibility and transparency**: Processes are open to users and auditors
* **Respect for user privacy**: Interfaces are user-friendly and offer meaningful control

#### **Example**

An online photo sharing platform that uses privacy by design would:

* Require explicit consent before sharing images
* Offer fine-grained control over who can view each image
* Avoid collecting location metadata unless the user opts in
* Let users download or delete their data at any time

### **How they work together**

Although security by design and privacy by design are distinct, they are complementary.

* **Security by design** protects data from threats and unauthorised access
* **Privacy by design** governs **why** and **how** data is collected and used in the first place

Together, they help ensure software systems are **resilient**, **trustworthy**, and **compliant** with ethical and legal expectations.

| **Security by Design**               | **Privacy by Design**                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on protection from attackers | Focuses on protection from misuse/overreach |
| Enforces technical safeguards        | Enforces data minimisation and consent      |
| Involves developers and engineers    | Involves developers, legal teams, UX        |
| Defends against external threats     | Respects user rights and expectations       |

### Defence in depth

Defence in Depth is a cybersecurity strategy employing multiple security control layers to protect critical assets. This approach ensures that if one defensive measure fails, others remain in place to thwart potential threats.

1. **Physical Security**\
   Controls that prevent unauthorised physical access to IT systems, such as security guards or locked doors.
2. **Technical Security:** Measures that protect network systems or resources using specialised hardware or software, such as firewalls or antivirus programs.
3. **Administrative Security:** Policies or procedures directed at an organisation’s employees, like instructing users to label sensitive information as “confidential”.

By implementing these layers, organisations create a robust security posture that addresses various attack vectors, thereby enhancing the overall protection of their critical assets.
