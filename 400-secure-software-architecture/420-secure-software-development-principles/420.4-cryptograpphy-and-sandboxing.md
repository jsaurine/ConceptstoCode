* Use and explain the contribution of cryptography and sandboxing to the ‘security by design’ approach in the development of software solutions

- Apply security features incorporated into software, including data protection, security, privacy and regulatory compliance

### What is cryptography?

**Cryptography** is the practice of securing information by encoding it so that only authorised parties can understand or use it. It is a foundational part of secure software systems.

Cryptographic techniques are used to:

* Protect data **in transit** (e.g. HTTPS[^1])
* Protect data **at rest** (e.g. [encrypted storage](#user-content-fn-2)[^2])
* Verify authenticity (e.g. [digital signatures](#user-content-fn-3)[^3], HMAC[^4])
* Prevent tampering (e.g. checksums[^5], hashes[^6])
* Securely store passwords (e.g. [salted hash](#user-content-fn-7)[^7] using SHA-256 or bcrypt)

### Why cryptography matters in design

Rather than being added as a patch, cryptographic features should be **integrated into the system's design**. This includes:

* Choosing strong algorithms (e.g. AES, SHA-256, bcrypt)
* Deciding **where** and **when** to encrypt data
* Using secure key management practices
* Complying with legal or regulatory frameworks (e.g. GDPR, CPS234)

#### Example decisions:

* Should passwords be hashed and salted before storage? (Yes)
* Should file uploads be encrypted before being written to disk? (Depends on risk profile)
* Should API tokens expire? (Yes, and they should be signed or encrypted)

### Common architecture patterns that embed security

Secure architecture patterns are reusable designs that address common threats or system goals. Examples include:

| **Pattern**                            | **Purpose**                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encrypted data vault**               | Protect sensitive fields in databases                       |
| **Zero-trust network model**           | Require verification of every request, internal or external |
| **Fail securely**                      | Ensure systems default to denying access on error           |
| **Secure defaults**                    | Enable protection features unless explicitly turned off     |
| **Layered defence (defence in depth)** | Combine multiple security controls at different layers      |

These patterns support system-wide enforcement of **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** — the same goals as the CIA Triad.

### Summary

* Cryptography is used to protect data, verify identity, and detect tampering
* Security by design includes selecting and applying cryptographic techniques early in the lifecycle
* Architecture patterns embed protection into the system structure, not just the code
* Compliance and resilience depend on both **technical correctness** and **design intent**



[^1]: **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure** (HTTPS) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data between a web browser and server using TLS (Transport Layer Security), protecting it from interception or tampering during transmission.

[^2]: Encrypted storage protects files or database records by converting them into unreadable ciphertext using a cryptographic key, ensuring that even if the data is accessed without permission, it cannot be interpreted.

[^3]: A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, file, or document. It uses the sender’s private key to sign and the recipient’s public key to validate.

[^4]: **Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)** is a technique that combines a message with a secret key using a cryptographic hash function to verify both its authenticity and integrity — often used in secure APIs and webhooks.

[^5]: A checksum is a small, fixed-length value generated from a larger set of data using a hash or algorithm. It is used to detect accidental errors or corruption by comparing the original and received checksum values.

[^6]: A hash function is a one-way process that converts input data into a fixed-length string (a hash). It is used for verifying data integrity, securing passwords, and supporting cryptographic operations because it cannot be reversed.

[^7]: A **salted hash** combines a password with a unique random value (called a salt) before applying a hash function. This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to guess passwords that share the same hash.
