### Impacts of insecure software

Insecure software can have wide-ranging consequences affecting individuals, businesses, and society. Understanding these impacts helps highlight why secure software development practices are crucial. Below are the main social, ethical, and legal issues associated with insecure software, enriched with Australian examples and case studies.

### Employment

The rise in cyberattacks has reshaped employment landscapes, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, data breaches and software vulnerabilities can lead to job losses within affected companies due to financial strain. On the other hand, they fuel demand for skilled cybersecurity professionals, driving growth in that sector.

The [2022 Optus data breach](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/alerts/optus-data-breach?ref=search), one of Australia’s largest, led to significant company upheaval and urgent investments in cybersecurity. While the breach harmed the company’s reputation and caused widespread disruptions, it underscored the growing need for cybersecurity jobs, promoting investment in training programs for Australian professionals.

The cybersecurity job market in Australia has seen a spike, with reports indicating that thousands of jobs remain unfilled as organisations focus on preventing future breaches.

<summary>Optus Data Breach</summary>

In **September 2022**, **Optus**, one of Australia's largest telecommunications providers, suffered a significant data breach that exposed the personal data of approximately **9.8 million customers**. The breach was attributed to an exploited vulnerability in an **unsecured API**, which allowed attackers to access customer information without authentication. The exposed data included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and, for some users, sensitive information such as passport and driver’s license numbers.

Optus faced significant backlash from public and government officials due to perceived gaps in its data security protocols. The Australian Government introduced measures to support affected customers, such as expedited document replacements and enhanced data protection policies. This breach led to discussions about strengthening cybersecurity regulations in Australia and ensuring companies take greater responsibility for securing customer data.

### Data Security

Data security is fundamental to protecting personal and enterprise information from unauthorised access. Breaches due to insecure software can compromise sensitive data, leading to financial, legal, and reputational damage.

In 2018, Australian health provider HealthEngine experienced a breach where patient data was shared with law firms without explicit consent. This incident sparked discussions on data handling ethics and compliance with the Privacy Act 1988. The breach highlighted vulnerabilities in managing personal health information, prompting stricter data security measures.

The Australian Government’s **Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme** mandates that organisations report data breaches likely to cause serious harm. This scheme increases accountability and awareness about data security risks.

<summary>HealthEngine Data Breach</summary>

In 2020, **HealthEngine**, Australia’s largest online medical appointment service, faced a significant fine of **$2.9 million** after the **Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)** found it had engaged in misleading conduct. Between 2014 and 2018, HealthEngine provided personal data—including names, dates of birth, phone numbers, and emails—of over **135,000 patients** to private health insurance brokers without adequately informing or obtaining consent from those individuals. Additionally, HealthEngine was found to have manipulated or selectively published patient reviews to present health providers more favourably, impacting patient choices based on incomplete or edited feedback.

This breach raised serious concerns about transparency and consumer rights under the **Australian Consumer Law (ACL)**, highlighting the ethical and privacy implications of data misuse by digital platforms. Following the investigation, HealthEngine was required to inform affected users and overhaul its data handling and transparency practices.

</details>

### Privacy

Privacy is deeply intertwined with data security. Insecure software can lead to the unauthorised exposure of personal information, violating individuals' privacy rights and trust in organisations.

The Medibank cyberattack in 2022 affected millions of Australians. Hackers accessed highly sensitive personal data, including medical histories, leading to significant privacy concerns. This incident highlighted how healthcare providers protect patient data and maintain confidentiality.

The **Privacy Act 1988** and the **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)** set strict rules for organisations collecting, using, and managing personal information. Breaches can result in severe penalties, reinforcing the need for robust security measures to uphold privacy.

<summary>Medibank Cyberattack</summary>

In October 2022, **Medibank**, a leading Australian health insurer, detected suspicious activity within its network, eventually exposing personal and sensitive data from 9.7 million current and former customers. The compromised information included names, dates of birth, Medicare and passport numbers, and health claim details. This breach had severe implications for customer privacy and raised significant concerns about how sensitive health data is protected.

The attackers, believed to be affiliated with the **BlogXX ransomware group**, threatened to release the data if Medibank did not comply with their ransom demand of USD $10 million. Medibank refused to pay the ransom, citing ethical and practical reasons, including the risk of incentivising future attacks. The hackers began releasing segments of the stolen data on the dark web.

The breach prompted Medibank to engage cybersecurity experts and collaborate with Australian regulatory bodies, including the **Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)**, to mitigate the damage and enhance security measures.
