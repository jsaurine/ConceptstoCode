# 430.3 Social and environmental impact

### TL;DR

Software is not neutral. It changes the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. From digital disruption and automation to environmental impact and inclusive access, developers must consider the broader consequences of the technologies they build. This topic explores the role of software in shaping social systems, employment, and sustainability.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Explain the concept of digital disruption and how software changes industries and workforces
* Evaluate how automation affects employment, productivity, and equity
* Describe the environmental impact of software systems, including energy use and e-waste
* Identify strategies to minimise environmental and social harm when developing software
* Reflect on how inclusive and sustainable software design can promote fairness and well-being

### Digital disruption and transformation

Software is transforming industries—replacing traditional models with faster, data-driven, often decentralised alternatives. This process is known as digital disruption.

#### Examples

* Ride-sharing apps are disrupting the taxi industry
* Streaming services are replacing traditional television
* E-commerce platforms are reducing the need for physical retail spaces

Disruption isn’t always negative—it can improve convenience, access, and innovation—but it also creates winners and losers. Ethical developers must consider who benefits and who may be left behind.

### Automation and the changing nature of work

Software-powered automation has created more efficient workflows in industries such as manufacturing, finance, logistics, and customer service. However, it raises concerns about job displacement, deskilling, and inequity.

Ethical questions include:

* What happens to workers whose roles are automated?
* How can developers design systems that support workers, rather than replace them?
* How can automation be used to improve inclusion and accessibility?

#### Example

Automating data entry might save time for higher-level analysis, but removing human oversight in sensitive areas (like hiring or sentencing decisions) can result in biased or unaccountable outcomes.

### Environmental impact of software systems

Software systems have a physical footprint, even when running in the cloud. This includes:

* Energy consumption from data centres, mining cryptocurrencies, or training AI models
* E-waste from frequent hardware upgrades prompted by software requirements
* Carbon emissions from electricity generation powering cloud infrastructure

Developer choices that affect environmental impact:

* Writing efficient code that reduces CPU cycles and energy use
* Avoiding feature bloat that forces users to upgrade hardware unnecessarily
* Selecting cloud providers that use renewable energy
* Supporting device repairability and longevity through sustainable design

### Inclusive access and social equity

Not all users experience software in the same way. Developers should consider:

* Digital divide – not everyone has reliable internet or the latest devices
* Accessibility – people with disability require alternative interfaces or navigation
* Cultural relevance – localisation and translation affect usability and inclusion
* Affordability – free or low-cost versions support broader access

#### Example

An educational app designed for low-bandwidth regions, with offline access and lightweight file sizes, supports more equitable access than one that assumes constant high-speed connectivity.

### Case study: Environmental impact of Bitcoin mining

Bitcoin relies on a process called proof of work, which consumes vast amounts of electricity. Studies have shown that global Bitcoin mining uses more energy annually than some countries.

Software factors contributing to this impact:

* Algorithmic design that rewards raw computing power
* Lack of built-in energy efficiency mechanisms
* Incentive structures that prioritise profit over sustainability

Developers working on future blockchain technologies are exploring alternatives like proof of stake to reduce this footprint.
