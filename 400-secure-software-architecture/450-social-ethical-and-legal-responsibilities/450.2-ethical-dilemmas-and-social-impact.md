* Explain the social, ethical and legal implications of software engineering, including:
  * access and equity
  * algorithmic bias and fairness
  * digital disruption and environmental impact
  * ethical responsibilities of developers

### Understanding ethical responsibility

Software is not neutral. Every design decision — from the way users log in, to the data that is collected, to the algorithms that make decisions — affects real people. Engineers have a responsibility to consider not just what software _can_ do, but what it _should_ do.

This includes thinking about:

* **Who benefits or is excluded** from a system
* **What assumptions are baked into the code**
* **How failures or misuse might affect people or communities**

### Common ethical dilemmas in software

| Scenario                                                                                               | Ethical concern                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| A social media platform personalises content to increase engagement, even if it spreads misinformation | Algorithmic bias and public harm   |
| A login system assumes all users have mobile phones for 2FA                                            | Access and equity                  |
| A company uses location data without informing users                                                   | Informed consent and privacy       |
| An AI system is trained on biased or incomplete data                                                   | Discrimination and unfair outcomes |

Developers must recognise when technical solutions **raise moral questions** and apply strategies to resolve them thoughtfully.

### Social and environmental impact

Software also shapes society in broader ways. It can:

* Replace or transform entire industries (digital disruption)
* Influence how people access education, healthcare, or justice
* Contribute to inequality if designed without inclusion in mind
* Consume energy and resources at scale (e.g. data centres, blockchain mining)

Sustainable, inclusive software design considers both **who is affected** and **how the system uses resources**.

### Thinking frameworks for analysis

To reason through ethical decisions, developers can use structured questions:

* Who benefits? Who is disadvantaged?
* What happens if the system fails?
* Would I be comfortable if this affected me or someone I care about?
* Does the software align with my organisation’s values and legal obligations?

These questions aren’t always easy, but asking them is essential to responsible engineering.

### Summary

* Ethical dilemmas are common in software design and development
* Engineers must consider fairness, bias, access, and long-term consequences
* Thoughtful reasoning and inclusive design improve outcomes for everyone
