# 410.3 Security and privacy by design

### Objectives

* Identify how secure systems protect users, organisations, and infrastructure
* Explain the broader advantages of building systems that are secure by design
* Recognise how security supports compliance, trust, and long-term system stability

### Understanding the benefits of secure systems

Security is not just about defence — it’s about creating systems that are **trustworthy, stable, and future-ready**. Well-designed secure systems benefit everyone involved: users, organisations, developers, and regulators.

They are more maintainable, more predictable under pressure, and better prepared for incidents or change.

### Protecting users and data

Secure systems protect individuals from:

* Identity theft and data breaches
* Account hijacking or manipulation
* Privacy violations and surveillance
* Service disruption and information loss

Well-designed systems create **trust**, especially in environments where personal or sensitive data is collected.

### Reducing organisational risk

Secure software helps organisations avoid:

* Financial loss due to system failure or downtime
* Legal action following data breaches or compliance failures
* Reputational damage and loss of customer confidence
* Unexpected engineering costs due to rushed patching or audits

Security investments can **reduce long-term costs** and increase stability.

### Improving system sustainability

Secure systems are:

* Easier to test and update
* More robust when dealing with unexpected inputs
* Designed with modularity and fail-safes in mind
* Aligned with privacy, accessibility, and legal standards

Compliance requirements like **GDPR**, **CPS234**, and **ISO/IEC 27001** are easier to meet when systems are secure by design.\

### Summary

* Secure systems protect users and organisations from harm
* Benefits include trust, stability, compliance, and maintainability
* Secure design reduces long-term costs and risk exposure
