# 410 Guiding principles

### Overview

Security is not something that can be added at the end of the software development process. It must be designed from the beginning — shaped by purpose, informed by risk, and responsive to how real people use software in a connected world.

This section introduces the foundational principles of secure software architecture. You'll begin by exploring what "secure" actually means, why it matters, and how to think in terms of protection, resilience, and trust.

### Objectives

In this section, you will:

* Define secure software and how it differs from "working" software
* Explore the CIA Triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
* Identify the practical and strategic benefits of building secure systems
* Distinguish between "security by design" and "privacy by design"

These concepts will shape your thinking as we move into the development lifecycle, coding practices, and strategies for resilience.

### Syllabus alignment

* Describe the benefits of developing secure software, including: \
  \- data protection\
  \- minimising cyber attacks and vulnerabilities
* Describe how the capabilities and experience of end users influence the secure design features of software
