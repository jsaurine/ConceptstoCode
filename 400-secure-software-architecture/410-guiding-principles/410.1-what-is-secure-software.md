# 410.1 What is secure software?

### What is secure software?

Secure software is software that works reliably, predictably, and safely — even when it’s used in unexpected ways or under attack. It anticipates risks, protects information, and maintains functionality under pressure. It also respects user privacy and maintains integrity, even in the event of an error.

In today’s connected world, software doesn’t live in isolation. It’s integrated with other services, accessed by users, and targeted by malicious actors. A single overlooked decision in the design phase can lead to serious vulnerabilities.

  – minimising cyber attacks and vulnerabilities

### A working definition

A secure system preserves three key qualities, even under stress:

* **Confidentiality** – Only authorised users can access sensitive data
* **Integrity** – Data and system behaviour are trustworthy and accurate
* **Availability** – The system remains usable when needed

These principles are known as the **CIA Triad**, which you’ll explore next.

### Why software security matters

Secure systems protect people, organisations, and society.

Real-world consequences of insecure systems include:

* Data theft and identity fraud
* Ransomware attacks
* System outages and financial loss
* Reputational damage and legal liability

Security isn’t just a technical requirement — it’s a professional responsibility.

### Where vulnerabilities begin

Most vulnerabilities arise when systems are not designed with security in mind. Examples include:

* Input not validated
* Weak passwords or hardcoded credentials
* Unhandled exceptions
* Poor separation between components

Secure design requires **intentionality and foresight** from the start.

### Building toward deeper understanding

This topic introduces a mindset you’ll use across the chapter. You’ll learn to:

* Identify what makes a system insecure
* Design features that anticipate threats
* Balance functionality with resilience
* Understand how software interacts with people and systems

### Key concepts

* Secure software anticipates and defends against threats
* The CIA Triad defines essential goals for secure systems
* Security begins in design and continues throughout development
