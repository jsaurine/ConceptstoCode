# 410.4 Privacy by design vs. security by design

### Objectives

* Distinguish between privacy by design and security by design
* Explain how these principles influence software architecture
* Identify situations where privacy and security goals align — or compete

### Understanding the distinction

**Privacy by design** and **security by design** are related but distinct principles. Both aim to protect users and reduce harm, but they do so in different ways.

* **Privacy by design** focuses on **limiting what data is collected, stored, and shared**
* **Security by design** focuses on **protecting data and systems from attack or misuse**

Good software architecture includes **both**, but developers must understand how they interact and where tensions may arise.

### Privacy by design

Privacy by design ensures that data collection and processing **respect user autonomy and legal protections**. It is a proactive approach: privacy is built in, not added later.

**Examples of privacy by design:**

* Collecting only necessary user data
* Giving users control over what’s shared
* Anonymising or deleting personal information
* Minimising third-party data exposure

**Key questions architects ask:**

* Do we need to collect this information at all?
* Can users opt in or out?
* Who else can see this data?

### Security by design

Security by design ensures that **whatever data is collected** is **stored, accessed, and transmitted safely**. It anticipates threats and builds defences into the system.

**Examples of security by design:**

* Encrypting personal data in transit and at rest
* Limiting access through authentication and authorisation
* Validating input and guarding against injection attacks
* Monitoring for misuse or unauthorised access

**Key questions architects ask:**

* How could this data be exploited?
* What controls are in place to protect it?
* What happens if a component fails or is attacked?

### Balancing privacy and security

These principles are not in conflict, but they must be balanced

* **Collecting more data** may help detect threats (security), but can create privacy risk
* **Strong authentication** protects access (security), but may make systems harder to use (privacy/usability)
* **Anonymising logs** protects privacy, but may limit forensic analysis (security)

Secure, privacy-aware systems are designed with **trade-offs in mind**. Architecture choices should be documented and justified.

### Summary

* Privacy by design limits what data is collected and how it is used
* Security by design protects systems and data from misuse or attack
* Secure, ethical software requires both, even when goals compete
* Architects must evaluate trade-offs and justify decisions
