# 440 When things go wrong

No system is perfect. Even well-designed software can fail, be exploited, or behave in an unintended way. How developers prepare for, detect, and respond to those failures matters. In this section, students explore what happens when software security breaks down—and what professional teams do to recover. Through real-world case studies, practical strategies, and technical approaches, you’ll learn how to build systems that are not only functional but also resilient.

This section builds on earlier topics in secure design (420) and ethical responsibility (430), focusing on what happens when systems are breached, data is lost, or trust is damaged, and how to handle those situations effectively.

{% tab title="Targets" %}
In this topic, students learn to:

* Identify common vulnerabilities and assess risk in software systems
* Investigate how real-world failures occur and what lessons they reveal
* Analyse the ethical, social, legal, and technical impacts of security breakdowns
* Explore how teams respond to software incidents using structured plans and tools
* Apply principles of system resilience and business continuity to support uptime and recovery

In a connected world, the consequences of software failure are significant. Whether a minor system glitch or a major data breach occurs, how a developer or team responds to failure can affect user safety, corporate trust, and national security. This section teaches students that secure software is not just about writing clean code. It's about designing for uncertainty and knowing how to recover when the unexpected happens.

You’ll explore the technical tools (like vulnerability scanning and incident response playbooks) and the social dimensions (like public trust, legal fallout, and ethical responsibility) that shape real-world outcomes. By studying past failures and best-practice responses, students learn to think like professionals who are prepared to build and protect.
