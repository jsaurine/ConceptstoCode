# 422.45 Security hardening and fault tolerance

### Overview

Security hardening and fault tolerance are advanced strategies that improve the resilience of software systems. Hardening involves reducing the system’s attack surface by disabling unnecessary features, tightening configurations, and enforcing strict policies. Fault tolerance ensures that the system continues functioning, even when components fail or unexpected errors occur.

Together, these techniques help create robust software that performs safely and predictably, even under pressure from attackers or unexpected failures.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Apply techniques for hardening systems to reduce vulnerabilities
* Understand how fault-tolerant systems recover from failure
* Evaluate the effectiveness of configuration settings and backups
* Design software with built-in resilience

**Developing secure code**

* Test and evaluate the security and resilience of software by determining vulnerabilities, hardening systems, handling breaches, and maintaining business continuity

### What is security hardening?

Security hardening refers to systematically reducing a system's vulnerabilities. This can apply to:

* Software applications
* Operating systems
* Databases
* Network devices

#### Common hardening techniques:

* **Remove unused services or features** to reduce potential entry points
* **Change default passwords and credentials**
* **Disable unnecessary ports and APIs**
* **Apply the principle of least privilege** to user accounts
* **Use secure configuration templates** or baselines
* **Apply security patches and updates** regularly
* **Restrict access** to files, directories, and system commands

#### Example:

A web server that doesn’t use FTP or SSH should have those services disabled and their ports closed to prevent scanning or brute-force attacks.

### What is fault tolerance?

Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating when part of it fails. This is essential for critical systems where downtime or data loss could cause serious harm.

#### Fault tolerance strategies:

* **Redundancy**: Using backup components or duplicated services (e.g. failover servers)
* **Graceful degradation**: If a component fails, the system reduces functionality instead of crashing
* **Automated recovery**: Detect failures and restart processes without user intervention
* **Input validation**: Catch errors before they corrupt the system
* **Fail securely**: Default to denial of access or safe defaults if a fault occurs

### Secure design patterns that support resilience

* **Watchdog timers**: Automatically reset stalled systems or services
* **Rate limiting**: Prevent denial-of-service attacks from overwhelming the system
* **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly to avoid overloading a single server
* **Logging and monitoring**: Detect anomalies and allow for rapid diagnosis

### Summary

* Security hardening reduces the number of ways a system can be attacked
* Fault tolerance ensures that systems remain available even under failure
* Together, they build trust and robustness into secure software
* Secure systems anticipate failure and plan for recovery, not just prevention
