# 422.52 SAST and DAST

### Overview

Secure software development requires both **static** and **dynamic** analysis techniques to detect vulnerabilities. These techniques allow developers to identify issues early in development (before the code is run) and also catch problems that appear during execution.

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** scans source code, bytecode, or binaries for insecure patterns **without running the program**.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** interacts with the running application, simulating real-world attacks to test how it behaves in practice.

Using both SAST and DAST together improves coverage and reduces the chance of undetected vulnerabilities reaching production.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Distinguish between SAST and DAST and explain how they work
* Identify what types of vulnerabilities each method detects
* Evaluate the strengths and limitations of each testing strategy
* Use testing tools to identify insecure code and system behaviour

**Developing secure code**

* Apply and evaluate strategies used by software developers to manage the security of programming code, including\
  –  static application security testing (SAST)\
  –  dynamic application security testing (DAST)

### What is SAST?

SAST is a white-box testing technique. It scans code **without executing it**, identifying vulnerabilities early in development.

#### Examples of vulnerabilities detected:

* Hardcoded passwords or secrets
* Unsafe string concatenation (e.g. SQL injection)
* Missing input validation
* Deprecated or dangerous function use

#### Common tools:

* SonarQube
* Bandit (Python)
* Semgrep
* ESLint Security plugins
* Fortify SCA

#### Sample detection (Python):

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + user_input + "'"
```

A SAST tool would flag this as vulnerable to SQL injection.

### What is DAST?

DAST is a black-box testing technique. It runs against a **live application** to simulate attacks and analyse real-world behaviour.

#### Examples of vulnerabilities detected:

* Misconfigured authentication
* Insecure error handling
* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Session management issues
* Unhandled server errors or timeout behaviour

#### Common tools:

* OWASP ZAP
* Burp Suite
* Arachni
* Nikto

DAST is useful when source code is not available or when testing production or staging environments.

### Key differences

| Feature               | SAST                       | DAST                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Access to source code | Required                   | Not required                        |
| When it runs          | During development (early) | During or after deployment          |
| Test method           | White-box                  | Black-box                           |
| Detects               | Code structure flaws       | Runtime behaviour and configuration |
| Best for              | Finding logic errors early | Validating user experience security |

### When to use each method

* Use **SAST** during development to:
  * Catch unsafe coding patterns early
  * Enforce secure coding standards
  * Reduce technical debt
* Use **DAST** during staging or post-deployment to:
  * Test system resilience under real-world conditions
  * Simulate attacker behaviour
  * Validate security controls (e.g. error messages, redirects)

### Combined approach

SAST and DAST should be used **together** for complete security testing:

* SAST finds flaws in source code before they become vulnerabilities
* DAST identifies what an attacker could exploit once the application is running

### Summary

* SAST scans code statically, helping catch issues early in development
* DAST tests the running application from the outside, simulating attacker behaviour
* Both methods are essential for finding different types of vulnerabilities
* Together, they form the foundation of a strong secure development pipeline
