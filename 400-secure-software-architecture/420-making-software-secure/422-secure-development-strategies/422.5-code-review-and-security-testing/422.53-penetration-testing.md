# 422.53 Penetration testing

### Overview

**Penetration testing**, or **ethical hacking**, is the process of simulating an attack on a system to find security weaknesses that malicious users could exploit. Unlike vulnerability assessments (which identify flaws), penetration tests go further—**they actively exploit vulnerabilities** in a controlled and legal way to measure risk and response.

Penetration testing is a critical step in securing high-risk systems. It reveals how an attacker might gain unauthorised access, extract data, or compromise functionality, and helps teams prioritise defence improvements.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Define penetration testing and its role in secure software development
* Distinguish between penetration testing and other security testing methods
* Describe the phases of a penetration test
* Identify tools and methods used in simulated attacks

**Developing secure code**

* Apply and evaluate strategies used by software developers to manage the security of programming code, including\
  –  penetration testing

### How does penetration testing work?

A penetration test typically follows these stages:

#### 1. **Planning and reconnaissance**

* Define scope and rules of engagement (what is tested and what’s off-limits)
* Gather information about the target system (e.g. open ports, DNS, IP ranges)

#### 2. **Scanning**

* Use tools to map the system’s structure
* Identify running services, exposed APIs, outdated software, etc.

#### 3. **Exploitation**

* Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities
* Escalate privileges, inject malicious code, or hijack sessions

#### 4. **Post-exploitation**

* Evaluate what an attacker could do after gaining access
* Test for data exfiltration, lateral movement, or persistence

#### 5. **Reporting**

* Document each step and its result
* Provide severity ratings, risk assessments, and remediation advice

### Penetration testing tools

Common tools include:

* **Metasploit** (exploit framework)
* **Burp Suite** (web app testing)
* **OWASP ZAP** (open-source DAST/pen testing)
* **Hydra** (brute-force attacks)
* **SQLMap** (SQL injection testing)
* **Wireshark** (network analysis)

These tools are typically used by security professionals trained in ethical hacking, but simplified environments (e.g. Hack The Box, TryHackMe) provide safe learning platforms.

### Pen testing vs other methods

| Method                 | Approach            | Focus                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **SAST**               | Static analysis     | Code logic and structure      |
| **DAST**               | Dynamic test        | Runtime behaviour (black-box) |
| **Vulnerability scan** | Passive scan        | Known issues and weaknesses   |
| **Penetration test**   | Active exploitation | Real-world attack simulation  |

### Best practices and legal considerations

* Always conduct pen testing **with written permission**
* Use **safe, controlled environments** to avoid disrupting services
* Follow ethical guidelines and disclose findings responsibly
* Coordinate with developers and stakeholders before and after testing

### Summary

* Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to evaluate system resilience
* It involves reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting
* Tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite help identify critical weaknesses
* Pen testing complements other testing methods and supports a proactive security strategy
