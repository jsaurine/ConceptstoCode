# 430 Writing secure code

### Objectives

* Identify and apply secure coding practices that address common software vulnerabilities
* Understand how poor coding practices can lead to security flaws such as cross-site scripting, broken authentication or race conditions
* Apply techniques such as input validation, secure API development, and session management to minimise risk

### Introduction

Secure software systems depend on how securely the code is written â€” not just how it is designed. Many common vulnerabilities arise from unvalidated input, unsafe API calls, weak memory or session management, or insufficient error handling.

This section introduces practical, syllabus-aligned coding practices that reduce risk and improve software resilience. You will examine input handling, secure APIs, basic cryptography, and memory/session/exception management.

Each subtopic connects directly to real threats, helping you understand how programming practices support the goals of secure architecture.
