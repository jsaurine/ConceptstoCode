### What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** enables one piece of software to communicate with another. It defines the rules for sending and receiving information between systems.

You’ve already used APIs without realising it:

* When an app loads your school timetable from a server
* When a weather widget shows live data
* When a game checks for updates or high scores online

#### Example:

A mobile app might call an API like this:

```
GET https://api.schoolapp.com/student/1234/timetable
```

The server checks who is asking, finds the correct timetable, and sends back a response — typically in a format such as JSON.

### Common methods of API authentication

There are many API authentication mechanisms, and each one operates differently. These four methods are among the most common:

#### HTTP basic authentication

<figure><img src="https://voyager.postman.com/illustration/http-basic-auth-diagram-postman.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p>HTTP basic authentication is the most rudimentary way to implement API authentication. It involves sending credentials as user/password pairs in an <code>Authorization</code> header field, where the credentials are encoded using Base64. However, these credentials are not hashed or encrypted, which makes this authentication mechanism insecure unless it is used in conjunction with HTTPS.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### API key authentication

<figure><img src="https://voyager.postman.com/illustration/api-key-auth-diagram-postman.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p>An <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-glossary/#api-key">API key</a> is a unique identifier that an API provider issues to registered users in order to control usage and monitor access. The API key must be sent with every request—either in the query string, as a request header, or as a cookie. Like HTTP basic authentication, API key authentication must be used with HTTPS to ensure the API key remains secure.</p></figcaption></figure>

### JWT authentication

<figure><img src="https://voyager.postman.com/illustration/jwt-auth-diagram-postman.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://blog.postman.com/what-is-jwt/">JWT</a>, which stands for JSON Web Token, is a compact, stateless mechanism for API authentication. When a user logs into an application, the API server creates a digitally signed and encrypted JWT that includes the user's identity. The client then includes the JWT in every subsequent request, which the server deserializes and validates. The user's data is therefore not stored on the server's side, which improves scalability.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### OAuth authentication

<figure><img src="https://voyager.postman.com/illustration/oauth-diagram-postman.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://blog.postman.com/what-is-oauth-2.0/">OAuth</a> is a token-based authentication mechanism that enables a user to grant third-party access to their account without having to share their login credentials. OAuth 2.0, which provides greater flexibility and scalability than OAuth 1.0, has become the gold standard for API authentication, and it supports extensive <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-integration/">API integration</a> without putting user data at risk.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Why APIs need security

APIs expose powerful functionality. If they are not protected, attackers can:

* Access other users’ private data
* Bypass the login system
* Change or delete database records
* Flood the server with requests (DoS)

This is why **API security and authentication** are essential.

### How to secure APIs

#### 1. Use HTTPS to encrypt all traffic

Without HTTPS, attackers could **intercept requests and steal data** (e.g. login credentials, session tokens). HTTPS uses TLS to keep communication confidential and tamper-proof.

#### 2. Authenticate every request

APIs must verify **who** is making the request, not just once at login, but **every time** a request is made. This is done using:

* **API keys** — unique to each application
* **Tokens** — e.g. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the request header
* **OAuth 2.0** — used by systems like Google, GitHub, and Canvas

#### Example: Token-based access in Python (simplified)

```python
# Backend checks for valid token before serving data
token = request.headers.get("Authorization")
if not verify_token(token):
    return "Access denied", 403
```

#### 3. Use access control (authorisation)

After authentication, check what the user **is allowed to do**. A student should not be able to access admin functions.

* Enforce **role-based permissions**
* Prevent access to sensitive routes without verification
* Never trust client-side checks (e.g. hiding a button is not enough)

#### 4. Validate and monitor API use

* Check all inputs (e.g. IDs, names, search terms)
* Reject invalid or dangerous requests
* Log access and errors to detect abuse
* Apply **rate limiting** to stop brute-force or spam attacks

### What is the difference between API authentication and API authorisation?

API authentication is often used alongside API authorisation, but they are not the same thing. While API authentication involves verifying a user's identity, API authorisation is the process of checking whether a user has the correct permissions to perform a specific task. It is often based on a user's role within an organisation, which may have a predefined access level. For instance, junior-level developers may only be able to read data from specific endpoints. In contrast, engineering managers might have read and write access to every API endpoint within their team's scope.

### Common API vulnerabilities

| **Vulnerability**          | **What happens**                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Broken authentication**  | Attackers reuse session tokens or guess credentials       |
| **Excessive exposure**     | API gives too much data in a single response              |
| **Injection attacks**      | User input is used unsafely in database or code execution |
| **Lack of access control** | Users access data or functions they shouldn’t             |

### Summary

* APIs are used to connect systems, but they can also expose sensitive functionality
* Authentication proves who is making a request; authorisation checks what they can do
* Use HTTPS, secure tokens, and input validation to protect APIs
* Secure APIs are a critical part of designing safe, reliable software systems
