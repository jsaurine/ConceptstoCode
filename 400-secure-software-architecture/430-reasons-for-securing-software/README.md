# 430 Reasons for securing software

### Overview

Secure software development is not just a technical requirement—it is an ethical, legal, and commercial necessity. Every choice a developer makes affects not just the system, but also the people who use it. This chapter explores the broader **reasons why software must be secure**.

Students will examine both the **positive impacts** of secure systems—such as trust, reliability, and compliance—and the **negative consequences** of insecure ones, including legal, ethical, and social fallout.

Case studies and real-world incidents are used to illustrate how poor security can have lasting impacts on organisations and individuals.

### Targets

In this chapter, students learn to:

* Describe the business, social, and legal benefits of secure software
* Analyse the consequences of security failures through real-world examples
* Explain how ethical responsibilities influence security decisions
* Understand how security contributes to product quality, trust, and long-term sustainability
