# 432.1 Impacts on people and society

### Overview

When software systems fail to protect users, the consequences can go far beyond technical disruption. Individuals may suffer **financial loss, psychological harm, or discrimination**, while broader society faces growing risks from data breaches, surveillance, and digital inequality.

This topic examines the human and societal costs of insecure software. It encourages developers to think beyond compliance and consider the **real-world outcomes** their code can produce, especially for vulnerable or disadvantaged communities.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Describe the ethical and social implications of insecure systems
* Explain how users may be harmed when security fails
* Identify how digital systems can reinforce inequality or exclude certain groups
* Evaluate the responsibility of developers to protect user wellbeing

**Impact of safe and secure software development**

* Evaluate the social, ethical and legal issues and ramifications that affect people and enterprises resulting from the development and implementation of safe and secure software, including:\
  &#x20;–  employment\
  &#x20;–  data security\
  &#x20;–  privacy\
  &#x20;–  copyright\
  &#x20;–  intellectual property\
  &#x20;–  digital disruption

### Ethical issues

Insecure systems raise ethical questions around:

* **Consent** – Are users aware of how their data is collected or shared?
* **Transparency** – Are risks and limitations clearly communicated?
* **Accountability** – Who is responsible when harm occurs?

Failing to secure software properly may violate the trust users place in developers and institutions.

### Social issues

Insecure systems can:

* Expose private communications or identity information
* Enable harassment or blackmail (e.g. through leaked personal photos)
* Allow manipulation or surveillance by third parties
* Undermine democratic processes (e.g. election interference)

The consequences of such breaches may be felt most by people who are already marginalised or at risk.

### Psychological harm

The emotional impact of data breaches and account compromises can include:

* Anxiety or fear of further exposure
* Loss of trust in institutions or services
* Feelings of helplessness or violation

Victims of doxxing, identity theft, or location tracking often experience lasting psychological effects.

### Impacts on disadvantaged groups

Insecure systems can unintentionally:

* **Exclude users** with disabilities (e.g. inaccessible security features)
* **Discriminate** against users through flawed algorithms or biased data
* **Target vulnerable populations** (e.g. migrants, survivors of violence)

Designing secure systems includes making sure protections apply equally to all users, regardless of their situation or technical skill.

### Summary

* Insecure software can cause harm far beyond the technical level
* Social, ethical, and psychological impacts must be considered in secure design
* Developers have a duty to consider the people who use their systems
* Secure systems are inclusive, respectful, and built with empathy for real-world users
