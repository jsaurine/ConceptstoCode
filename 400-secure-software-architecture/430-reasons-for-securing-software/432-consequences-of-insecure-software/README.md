# 432 Consequences of insecure software

### Overview

Insecure software doesn't just failâ€”it can **hurt people, damage reputations, break laws, and destroy trust**. When systems are compromised, the consequences are often wide-reaching, affecting individuals, organisations, and entire communities.

This section examines the **real-world impacts of security failures**, including ethical and social issues, financial and legal penalties, and case studies from major breaches. Students are encouraged to consider the **responsibility** that comes with writing software and the long-term consequences of overlooking secure practices.

### Targets

In this section, students learn to:

* Analyse the ethical and social effects of insecure software
* Identify legal and financial consequences that result from breaches
* Explore the broader impact on users, especially disadvantaged groups
* Evaluate real-world case studies of security failures
