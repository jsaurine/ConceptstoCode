# 432.2 Legal and financial consequences

### Overview

When software systems are compromised, the effects are not limited to technical recovery—they often carry **significant legal and financial consequences**. These may include **fines under data protection laws**, **civil lawsuits from affected users**, and even **business closure** following reputational loss.

This topic explores how insecure software can trigger legal action, financial liability, and strategic risk for organisations. It encourages students to view security not only as a technical requirement, but as a **critical part of business and governance**.

### Targets

In this topic, students learn to:

* Identify legal obligations related to software security and privacy
* Describe the financial risks of data breaches and security failures
* Explain how reputational damage can affect business continuity
* Evaluate the importance of compliance in software development

**Developing secure code**

* Evaluate the social, ethical and legal issues and ramifications that affect people and enterprises resulting from the development and implementation of safe and secure software, including:\
  &#x20;–  employment\
  &#x20;–  data security\
  &#x20;–  privacy\
  &#x20;–  copyright\
  &#x20;–  intellectual property\
  &#x20;–  digital disruption

### Breaches and liability

When a data breach or software failure occurs, organisations may be:

* **Held liable** for failing to protect user data
* **Sued** by affected individuals or partners
* **Investigated** by regulators under privacy or cybersecurity law

Failure to take reasonable security precautions may be considered negligence under civil law or a breach of statutory duty under legislation such as the **Australian Privacy Act 1988** or **GDPR**.

### Fines and legal penalties

Regulatory bodies may impose significant penalties for non-compliance. For example:

* In Australia, the **OAIC** (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner) can issue penalties for serious or repeated privacy breaches
* Under the **GDPR**, organisations can be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover
* Class-action lawsuits may result in damages paid to individuals whose data was exposed

### Business disruption and recovery costs

Security incidents often lead to:

* **Service outages** and downtime
* **Emergency response costs** (e.g. incident forensics, legal teams, PR consultants)
* **Remediation costs** (e.g. notifying users, offering identity protection)
* **Lost business** due to customer churn

Even a brief loss of service can affect critical operations, while large-scale incidents may take weeks or months to resolve fully.

### Reputational damage

Security failures can undermine user trust—sometimes permanently. Consequences include:

* **Loss of customer confidence**
* **Negative media coverage**
* **Regretful public disclosures**
* **Decreased market value or investment**

Reputation is difficult to rebuild after a high-profile breach, especially if the organisation is seen as careless or evasive.

### Summary

* Legal frameworks require developers to build software that protects user data and systems
* Failing to do so can result in fines, lawsuits, and legal investigations
* Financial impacts include service disruption, remediation costs, and long-term damage to brand reputation
* Secure development is essential not just for technical integrity, but for business survival.
